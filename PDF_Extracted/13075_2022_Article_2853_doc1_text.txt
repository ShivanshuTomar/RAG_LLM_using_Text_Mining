disease heritability indicates that the environmental factors involved in the disease are likely to be ubiquitous. AS is strongly associated with HLA-B27, which contributes roughly 20% of the disease’s heritability. The carriage of HLA alleles (including HLA-B27) has been correlated with microbial dysbiosis even in healthy subjects, indicating that the gut microbiome may be a driver of disease, as opposed to being secondary to it [4, 5]. There are at least 163 loci reported so far to be associated with IBD, with a strong overlap between the genes associated with AS and IBD [6].

Up to 70% of AS patients have evidence of terminal ileitis resembling IBD, suggesting gut inflammation is important in disease pathogenesis [7, 8]. Increased gut permeability has been demonstrated in AS patients consistent with the hypothesis that ‘leakiness’ to gut microbes may drive inflammation in the disease [9–12]. However, unlike ileal IBD, AS-associated terminal ileitis is very rarely trans-mural and does not cause strictures or perforation.

There is strong evidence to suggest that the gut microbiome or gut pathogens trigger the development of IBD [13]. Diversion of the faecal stream dramatically reduces the risk of disease recurrence in the neo-terminal ileum of IBD patients who have undergone ileal resection for severe disease, and antibiotics can similarly reduce the risk of post-operative recurrence of ileal disease [14, 15]. Genetic studies in IBD show a marked over-representation of genes which are also associated with the risk of developing mycobacterial diseases, including leprosy and tuberculosis [16]. Faecal microbiome transplants, correcting IBD-associated dysbiosis, are therapeutically effective in IBD [17].

To date, numerous studies have confirmed the differing microbial profiles of cases versus controls for both AS and IBD [13, 18–25]. Studies have also shown a relationship between disease activity and microbial profile [22]. Whilst mounting evidence indicates a causal role for gut microbiome in driving AS and IBD, immunological and genetic evidence implies differing modes of pathogenicity. The recent demonstration that treatment with vedolizumab, which is effective for IBD through its effect on reducing lymphocyte migration in the gut mucosa, can induce de novo axial spondyloarthritis, indicates that the mechanisms by which the gut is involved in driving IBD and AS have significant differences [26]. However, direct comparison of the AS and IBD microbiomes has not been possible due to divergence of metagenomic approaches and differences in population demographics. In this study, we collected stool samples, terminal ileal biopsies, colonic biopsies and rectal biopsies from Australian AS patients, IBD patients and healthy controls, as well as stool samples from Italian and Swedish AS patients to (1) test the hypothesis that the gut microbiome in AS and IBD is different, (2) compare the AS microbiome across different populations, and (3) investigate the relationship between AS and IBD disease activity with microbiome composition.

# Methods

# Human subjects

Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Princess Alexandra Hospital and the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) human research ethics committees (Metro South approval no. HREC/15/QPAH/309 and QUT approval no. 1600000188), and the research ethics committees of the University of Palermo (CE number 5/2014 16042014) and Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg (CE numbers 597-08 and 690 13). For the Australian and Italian cohorts, patients were recruited with written informed consent from rheumatology and gastroenterology endoscopy outpatient departments (Princess Alexandra Hospital (Australia), Logan Hospital (Australia), University of Palermo (Italy)), and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Borås Hospital and Alingsås Hospital, Sweden. An overview of the sampled cohorts is available in Table 1. AS was in each case defined according to the modified New York AS criteria [27].

For all Australian patients (AS, AS-IBD, IBD and HC), biopsies from the terminal ileum, rectum and right colon were acquired from patients undergoing routine colonoscopy, with samples gathered from neighbouring inflamed and non-inflamed tissue collected where possible. Stool samples were collected from the Australian and Italian cohorts. All samples were snap-frozen and stored at −80°C (mucosal biopsies) or −30°C (stool samples) prior to processing.

Overall, the Australian cohort consisted of 28 AS patients, 5 AS patients with concomitant IBD, 59 IBD patients and 105 healthy controls. The Italian cohort consisted of 16 AS patients. Stool samples from 136 AS patients, some sampled twice at a five-year interval, as part of the Swedish cohort were collected as previously described [25] and shipped frozen to Australia for DNA extraction and processing.

Across all cohorts, the participants were predominantly of Caucasian descent and followed an omnivorous diet. Patients with recent (6 months) antibiotic or probiotic usage were excluded from further analysis. Samples across all three cohorts were collected and processed at the same time using standardised techniques, as described below.
