As we show in Additional file 1: Fig. S12, the dysbiosis score was well validated across studies, except for healthy control samples and the negative control dataset. The Firmicutes-versus-Bacteroidetes tradeoff score, on the other hand, was reasonably well reproduced in all studies and particularly well-established in healthy samples, but, again, was not significantly detected in the negative control dataset.

# Continuous score assignment

Assignment of continuous scores was straightforward given the two consensus loading vectors provided by MMUPHin. Within each study, arcsin square root-transformed relative abundances were centered per-feature, the transformed abundance matrix was then multiplied by each consensus loading via dot product to generate per-sample continuous scores. These scores were used for visualization as in Fig. 4d and Additional file 1: Fig. S10, as well as for testing the difference between CD, UC, non-IBD, and healthy control populations as in Additional file 1: Fig. S16. We provide the two consensus loadings in Additional file 9: Table S7; interested researchers can follow these steps to assign the two continuous scores in other datasets.
