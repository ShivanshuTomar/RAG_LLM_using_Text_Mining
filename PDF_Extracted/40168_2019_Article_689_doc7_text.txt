# Metabolic Reconstructions

Each microbiome model was constrained with the “Average European” diet supplemented with conjugated primary bile acids (Additional file 1: Table S3). A typical personalized microbiome model contained 127 AGORA models and 142,000 reactions (Table 2) making this work one of the largest constraint-based modeling efforts to date.

# The Bile Acid Deconjugation and Biotransformation Potential is Variable in Healthy Individuals and Depleted in Crohn’s Disease Patients

To predict the maximally possible bile acid deconjugation and biotransformation potential of the 194 microbiome models, we performed flux balance analysis while maximizing for the fecal secretion reaction flux (mmol × person-1 × day-1) of the primary bile acids, CA and CDCA, and 13 secondary bile acids (Fig. 3b, c and Additional file 1: Table S6). The quantitative production potential varied significantly between the models, with the quantitative production potential of LCA and DCA varying by a factor of 100 (Additional file 1: Table S6). A statistical analysis (Wilcoxon rank sum test, with p values adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR) by Benjamini-Hochberg method) was performed on the total community production potential of the 20 IBD patients (IBD_pediatric) and the 25 control microbiomes (Healthy_pediatric) (Fig. 3b, c, Additional file 1: Table S7). Compared with the microbiomes of healthy children, the IBD patient microbiomes were significantly depleted in 12-dehydrocholate production potential (p value < 0.001). Primary bile acid deconjugation potential was lower in IBD patients but only borderline significant after adjustment for FDR (adjusted p value = 0.0551); however, the abundance of the bile salt hydrolase reaction was significantly reduced in IBD microbiomes (p value 0.0235, Additional file 1: Table S7) and also differed based on phylum-and genus-level reaction abundances for many taxa (Additional file 1: Table S7). Microbiomes with low CA/CDCA liberation potential from the conjugated bile acids also had a low secondary bile acid potential (Additional file 1: Table S6) in agreement with the fact that the bile salt hydrolase is the gateway reaction in the pathway [39]. Taken together, we predicted the inter-person variability in the bile acid biosynthesis potential with microbiomes from IBD patients being significantly depleted in bile acid deconjugation and biotransformation potential, consistent with reports that IBD patients have higher levels of fecal conjugated and lower levels of secondary bile acids [5].

# Functional Analysis of Strain-Level Contributions in Each Microbiome

What is the contribution of individual strains to the overall bile acid deconjugation and biotransformation potential? While previous studies have correlated certain taxa to measured metabolite levels [40], we determined here exactly which strains were producing the bile acids in the individual microbiome models using the aforementioned simulation results. Overall, 198 strains contributed to total production flux of at least one bile acid in at least one microbiome model (Additional file 1: Table S8). Of those, 15 strains contributed in > 90% of communities across both cohorts and thus play a significant role in bile acid metabolism. These strains included known commensals, such as Ruminococcus gnavus ATCC 29149, Coprococcus comes ATCC 27758, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii L2_6, Clostridium sp. M62_1, Eubacterium ventriosum ATCC 27560, Bacteroides pectinophilus ATCC 43243, and Dorea formicigenerans ATCC 27755. A variety of Bacteroides strains performed bile acid deconjugation and 7-keto-DCA/7-dehydro-CDCA biosynthesis, and their contribution was significantly depleted in the IBD microbiomes (p values for all < 0.01, Additional file 1: Table S7). Consistently, a positive correlation between Bacteroides spp. and secondary bile acid biosynthesis was found [36]. Using a Principal Coordinates Analysis on the strain-level contributions, we observed a clear separation between the IBD patients and controls (Fig. 3d), as well as between the HMP individuals and the pediatric individuals, due to the difference in strains (Fig. 3d, Additional file 2: Figure S7). The strain difference is most likely due to differences in age, location, and ethnicity of the two cohorts. On the phylum level, the contributions in both the healthy adult and healthy pediatric microbiomes were mostly driven by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes representatives, as expected, while Proteobacteria contributed significantly in the IBD microbiomes (p values for all < 0.05, Additional file 1: Table S7 and Additional file 2: Figure S7). A Wilcoxon rank sum test adjusted for FDR on strain-level contributions revealed that 303 strain-level contributions.
