# Depressive symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease

As reduced quality of life, the co-morbidity of depressive symptoms and IBD is associated with poor biomedical outcomes, including increased risk of IBD relapse, hospitalization and surgery [9].

A psychological model would position depressive symptoms as a secondary reaction to the burden of IBD, including difficulties with coping, disability, pain, socially unacceptable symptoms and fear of complications [10–12]. In turn, the poor prognosis of depressive symptoms could occur through negative effects on self-care and treatment adherence [13,14]. However, this model alone provides limited opportunities to improve outcomes. For example, there is an inconsistent correlation between the severity of IBD and the prevalence of depressive symptoms [15,16], and depressive symptoms correlate variably with treatment adherence [17]. While conventional treatments for depressive symptoms (such as cognitive behavioural therapy) frequently improve depressive symptoms in people with IBD, this does not consistently improve biomedical outcomes [18]. There is therefore a need to identify novel targets to reduce the risk of depressive symptoms and their impact in people with IBD.

Despite its beneficial short-term effects in combating infection and enabling tissue repair [19], there is compelling evidence that chronically elevated inflammation has deleterious effects on multiple systems in the body, including the brain and the gut [20,21]. The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of IBD is well established, in that cytokines drive intestinal inflammation and may also regulate extra-intestinal disease manifestations and systemic effects [21].

In this clinically focused review, we will argue that depressive symptoms are a further extra-intestinal manifestation of inflammation in people with IBD. After summarizing the epidemiology of the link between depressive symptoms and IBD, we will examine the evidence for inflammation as a cause of depressive symptoms or more commonly somatic symptoms such as fatigue. We will outline how dysregulation of the gut–brain axis may lead to an ‘inflammatory depression’, which fuels a vicious cycle of worsening IBD outcomes. Finally, we will argue that targeted anti-inflammatory treatments may improve co-morbid depressive symptoms in IBD, as well as providing a unique model for understanding the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms in the general population.

# Epidemiology

The detection of depressive symptoms in IBD depends on the method of measurement. Clinical depression is a diagnosis made using a detailed diagnostic interview [22]. It requires the minimum of two of three ‘core’ symptoms of low mood, anhedonia (reduced enjoyment) and increased fatiguability, in addition to at least two other symptoms (see Table 1), for a minimum of 2 weeks’ duration. Using this approach, the pooled prevalence of depression disorders in IBD is 15·2% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 9·9–20·5%] based on a meta-analysis of six estimates [8]. For the purpose of this review, the term ‘depression’ is therefore reserved for clinical depression only.

As diagnostic interview is time-intensive, most epidemiological studies of in IBD have instead measured depressive symptoms using self-report questionnaires, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). With such questionnaires, a validated cut-off score (for example, ≥ 10 on the PHQ-9 [23]) is typically used to define cases of depressive symptoms. Unlike clinical depression, such an approach does not distinguish between ‘core’ depressive symptoms and other symptoms. Unsurprisingly, this approach leads to a higher pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms of 21·6% (CI = 18·8–24·3%) in people with IBD [8]. Notably, there appears to be a difference in depressive symptoms between CD and UC (25·3 versus 16·7%, respectively) and between active disease versus remission (40·7 versus 16·5%) [8]. Clinic-based samples are likely to have either or both more severe IBD and other co-morbidities.

Prospectively, there is recent evidence from large database research that a prior diagnosis of depression is associated with greater incidence of IBD over time [24]. However, no prospective studies have examined the incidence of depressive symptoms and IBD in the same population. Separately, early life stress [25,26], poor diet [27,28] and smoking [28,29] have been found to confer vulnerability to both conditions. Smoking is further known to worsen outcomes in CD but not in UC [30] and smoking appears to be disproportionately common in female CD patients [31]. This suggests that lifestyle factors may have a more important role in the depressive symptoms of CD than in UC.

The relationship between depressive symptoms and adverse outcomes in IBD has been inconsistently demonstrated. A meta-analysis of five small prospective studies found little association [32], while a subsequent 2-year prospective study found no association between depressive symptoms and worsening IBD activity [33]. However, the latter study used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, which does not capture any somatic symptoms such as fatigue and sleep disturbance. As discussed later, these symptoms may be most associated with inflammation.

By contrast, larger studies have nearly all reported strong associations between depression and a worse IBD course. In database studies, a pre-existing diagnosis of clinical depression is associated with adverse outcomes in IBD [34–36]. A recent high-quality prospective cohort study.
