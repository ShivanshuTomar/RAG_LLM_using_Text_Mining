# Microbial diversity and richness

a Species richness is substantially less in CD patient samples compared to the healthy control and UC patient samples. Shannon alpha diversity plot demonstrate that CD patients samples are less diverse compared to the healthy control and UC patient samples (inset figure).

# The gut microbial abundance at different taxonomic levels in IBD patients

Compared to the healthy controls, both IBD patient groups (CD and UC patients) demonstrated strong microbial imbalance at different taxonomic levels (Fig. 2). At the phylum level, both IBD conditions exhibit an increased abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, relative to the controls. In particular, the abundance of this phyla during UC, was far greater than CD or healthy controls. For the two other dominant bacterial phyla, the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, the abundance profiles varied across disease conditions (Fig. 2a). In CD, the abundance of Bacteroidetes, which is often associated with a healthy gut, was deceased 2.4-fold, whereas the abundance of Proteobacteria, a phyla associated including wide variety of pathogens, was increased 3.8 fold. Interestingly, for patients with UC the abundance of Proteobacteria was decreased (3.4 fold) relative to controls and there was no significant differences in levels Bacteroidetes [26]. Several studies have reported the gut microbial imbalances for IBD, however, the imbalance at the level of different phylum is variable across studies [10, 13, 18, 21, 27, 28]. This could likely be a reflection on the lack of standardisation across microbiome techniques, or perhaps due to a heterogeneity in the microbiome associated with disease.

We further investigated how different taxonomic levels belonging to each of the main four phyla, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, were changed during IBD. For Firmicutes, the most abundant phylum in the gut in all conditions, we observed four classes and nine different families which changed in abundance relative to healthy controls. For CD patients, the abundance of two classes including Clostridia and Erysipelotrichia, was reduced, and three families including Ruminococcaceae, Christensenellaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae were reduced relative to healthy controls. The level of two other two classes such as Negativicutes and Bacilli (obligately aerobic) and five families including Veillonellaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Streptococcaceae and Peptostreptococcaceae was increased, similar to the imbalance in their parent phylum Firmicutes. Interestingly, Lachnospiraceae, the most abundant Firmicutes family, was at a similar level to the control. For UC patients, the abundance of the Firmicute classes Clostridia, Negativicutes and Bacilli, and
