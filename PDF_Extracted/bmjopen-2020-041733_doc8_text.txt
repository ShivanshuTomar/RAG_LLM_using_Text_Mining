# Open access

evaluated specifically in the paediatric population. This includes predictors of success and failure of therapy for IBD. Children developing IBD are predominantly treated from the time of first presentation at academic centres rather than in community practice. Hence, the paediatric collaborators in this proposal offer access to the broad spectrum of IBD, including prior to alteration of the microbiome by any therapy. We will evaluate predictors of success and failure of these therapies for IBD over time in the paediatric population.

We will evaluate subtypes of IBS; IBS-C, IBS-D and IBS-M. We will assess the microbiome, metabolomics, genetic, demographic and dietary predictors of response to therapies for IBS. Predictors of response to a low FODMAPs diet will help inform a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of low FODMAPs diet in IBS, and in particular we will evaluate whether responders are more likely to initially be taking a diet that is very rich in FODMAPs and how this response relates to their microbiome compositional and functional changes, affected by diets. A subgroup analysis will be performed of those between the ages of 13 and 17 years compared with adult patients. We will also evaluate those with stable coeliac disease and compare results to those without this disorder.

# DISSEMINATION

Our approach to dissemination involves developing evidence-based knowledge translation initiatives for research that is ready for prime time—for each of category of our three research partners (patient, clinicians and policymakers). For patients, we plan to create a ‘white label’ version of the McMaster Optimal Ageing Portal (https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org) that focuses specifically on supporting self-management and more generally informed decision-making for GI disease. This involves (1) identifying existing Evidence Summaries and preparing new ones to provide patients with the key messages from scientific research (typically high-quality systematic reviews) that are ready to be acted on; (2) identifying existing Web Resource Ratings and preparing new ones to help patients identify the free health resources on the internet that are based on scientific research; (3) identifying existing Blog Posts and preparing new ones that provide commentaries for patients about on what the scientific research on a topic actually means and on why good science matters; and (4) identifying existing patient decision aids to help patients (and clinicians working with patients) to engage in shared decision-making.

We will work with network partners (eg, CDHF and CCC) to determine the best online platform for patient-focused products, to develop inclusion criteria, and to ensure that their online resources focused on GI disease meet the high standard necessary to be captured and ranked highly in the Web Resource Ratings. We plan to prepare 52 new Evidence Summaries, 24 Blog Posts and 400 Web Resources Ratings for the ‘white label’ portal. We will also be working with network partners to ensure high rates of use of the white-label, GI disease-focused content site for patients.

The patients, family members and caregivers who live with the chronic conditions covered by the IMAGINE Network will be able to use the portal to find information that aids them in managing their conditions and making related health decisions. The content produced by the McMaster Optimal Ageing Portal has been shown to be effective in informing health consumers of quality health information related to ageing but not in other domains. We plan to conduct an RCT (which will be detailed in a separate protocol) to assess how the online resources for patients, provided through the white label website, changes patient behaviour in regards to using information and making evidence-informed health decisions.

For clinicians, we will follow an approach that emerged from a comprehensive review of the literature on scaling up effective clinical interventions (summarised in an evidence brief) and a stakeholder dialogue involving the key policymakers, stakeholders and researchers focused on supporting scale-up of effective clinical practices in Ontario (summarised in a dialogue summary): (1) supporting dynamic efforts to identify GI disease-related clinical practices to be optimised and the causes of underlying problems, using both empirical approaches like systematic reviews and theoretical approaches like the Behaviour Change Wheel and the Theoretical Domains Framework; (2) using rigorous processes to select and implement approaches to optimising clinical practices that address the underlying causes of problems (eg, audit and feedback, financial incentives); and (3) monitoring, evaluating and reviewing the approaches selected to optimise clinical practices. We plan to support two approaches: (1) prioritising clinical interventions to be scaled up by engaging network members using an explicit process; and (2) scaling up effective clinical interventions by developing and executing a scale-up plan, both of which will build on what has been learnt from related work at the McMaster Health Forum, and will rely on the frequent engagement of key members of the IMAGINE SPOR Network in doing so.

For policymakers, we will use our tried and tested approach to supporting evidence-informed policymaking, which means: (1) preparing an evidence brief on a pressing need for scale-up and the factors hindering that achievement (eg, nurses’ scope of practice, existing financial incentives, lack of multidisciplinary teams), options for scaling up and key implementation considerations (which includes an equity lens brought to bear on particularly vulnerable groups); (2) convening a stakeholder dialogue that brings together key policymakers, patient and clinical leaders and researchers who can consider the research evidence alongside the other factors that drive decision-making; and (3) preparing a dialogue summary, disseminating the evidence brief and dialogue summary, conducting personalised briefings to senior leaders in the system, and supporting their efforts to act on what they learnt.
