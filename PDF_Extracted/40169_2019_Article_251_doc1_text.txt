processing bacterial cells, which agrees with certain function of the gut–microbiota in IBD pathogenesis. On the basis of this, some therapeutic experimental models and clinical trials that seek to correct the alterations within the gut–microbiota which include fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics administration have shown promising outcomes in IBD [7].

Transplanted MSCs have also shown significant contributions towards the recovery of many diseases including IBD via engraftment and differentiation into functional reparative cells, replacement of injured tissues as well as the use of immune modulators or trophic resources. These mostly result in expressed paracrine factors that ultimately promote tissue repair [8]. MSC therapy has also been demonstrated to dampen inflammation, restore gut microbiome alteration and enhance pathogenic bacterial eradication culminating in reestablished gut health in IBD. Even though little is known about MSC–gut microbiota interaction, the few available studies indicate a positive communication which results in enhanced functions of both components. In this document, we review the therapeutic application of gut microbiota (FMT) and MSC in IBD, emphasizing on the common characteristic effects of these two therapies and how their interactions potentiate the functions of each other. We also discuss the way forward to a possible future FMT–MSC combined therapeutic approach.

# Features that differentiate UC and CD

Regardless of the fact that both UC and CD are labelled as IBD, there are significant differences between the two. These differences invariably affect their pathology and response to therapy. In CD, the location of the inflammation may occur anywhere along the digestive tract with deeper ulceration, thickened colon wall, patched inflammatory pattern, granulomas and possible fistulas, strictures and fissures in the complicated state [9]. On the other hand, UC is typically restricted to the large intestine (colon) with surface mucus lining ulceration, thinner and continuous inflammation of the colon wall with no patches, no granulomas, fistulas, strictures and fissures [9, 10].

A recent report indicates that at the pathway level, virus infection and autoimmune pathways are upregulated in CD but not in UC whilst pattern recognition-mediated innate immune pathways (TLR2 and TLR4) are appreciably raised in UC but not in CD [11]. This report identifies different intervention targets for effective treatment of the two diseases. The microRNA signatures of body fluids and tissues like saliva, blood and colon have also indicated significant variations between UC and CD. Schaefer et al. documented that, about 26 miRNAs are changed in UC and CD colon biopsies relative to non-IBD controls. Out of this number, UC was associated with the differential expression of 6 miRNAs whilst CD was associated with 10 miRNAs in matched colon tissues. In whole blood, altered expression of 9 miRNAs were linked to UC whilst 6 miRNAs were linked to CD. Similar alterations in expression were also noticed in the saliva of UC and CD patients [12]. This aberrant miRNA expression profiles are believed to contribute the IBD pathogenesis. Other approaches that have been employed to reveal the differences between these two diseases include signaling pathways and gene expressions [13], specific inflammasome [14] and extracellular matrix turnover profile [15].

# Role of gut microbiota in IBD

Researches sprouting out within the cross point between IBD and the microbiota are very promising and believed to soon significantly impact daily medical practice. Microbial profiles sometimes called “signatures” vary appreciably and enough between the diseased and the healthy individual [16]. The gut–microbiota has physiological functions that provide several health imparts to the host in relation to nutrition, pathogen protection, metabolism and immunity [17]. However, recent advances in clinical and experimental research have discovered alterations in the function and composition of the gut–microbiota (dysbiosis) in several diseases including IBD [18]. Though the exact cause of IBD is still not known, it is documented that its pathogenesis is closely linked with dysbiosis with the most consistent observation being reduced bacterial diversity; a decrease of Firmicutes, and an increase of Proteobacteria [7].

Research has confirmed several specific role of certain gut bacteria in relation to IBD pathogenesis and recovery. In some of these investigations, a reduction in Firmicutes such as F. prausnitzii, Roseburia inulinivorans, Blautia faecis, Clostridium lavalense and Ruminococcus torques were noticed in persons having CD compared to the healthy individuals [19, 20]. The quantity of F. prausnitzii in the gut correlated significantly with risk of ileac CD relapse after surgery and its population reconstitution after relapse is linked with the maintenance of clinical remission. Again, a decrease of Roseburia spp. predisposes a healthy individual to a high genetic risk for IBD [21]. However, an increase in Proteobacteria, mainly E. coli (38%), was observed in active CD patients compared to only 6% in healthy people [22]. Other increased bacteria population associated with IBD include mucolytic bacteria Ruminococcus torques and Ruminococcus gnavus [23]. These gut bacteria adhere to the intestinal epithelium consequently affecting intestinal permeability, altering diversity and composition of gut–microbiota and triggering inflammatory responses through the
