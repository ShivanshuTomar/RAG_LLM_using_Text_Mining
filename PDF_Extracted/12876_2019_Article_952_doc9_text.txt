IBD and that this is not only safe, but also represents an inexpensive strategy for the prevention and treatment of IBD-related sarcopenia and obesity-related metabolic disorders. Policy- and guideline-makers should consider the addition of regular aerobic and resistance training to current treatment algorithms for patients with IBD. Patients should be reassured that physical activity does not aggravate IBD activity, particularly in exercise that is gradual and controlled.

Moreover, this study addresses some of the unknowns relating to exercise in patients with IBD that have been highlighted previously by others [7, 11]. However, caution is required before advising patients with active disease; this requires more study and was not addressed in the current investigation.

# Authors’ contributions

OC, CM, DS, PC, FS and MGM conceived the study idea and design. OC formulated the exercise intervention. OC, CM, DS, and HN conducted study recruitment. OC, CBM, HN, CM and DS conducted enrolment, interventions, and clinical measurement. WB conducted DNA extraction from faeces, and subsequent sequencing analysis was performed by WB, RW and OOS. OC and YM performed the inflammatory cytokine measurement. OC, WB, and FS wrote the manuscript with review, editing and final approval from all authors.

# Ethics approval and consent to participate

Before commencement, the study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals. All patients provided written informed consent before enrolment.
