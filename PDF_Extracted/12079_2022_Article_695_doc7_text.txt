# IL-6/IL-6R Axis Inhibitors in the Treatment of IBD and CAC

Previous studies have shown that IL-6-deficient mice had moderated inflammatory responses after the induction of colitis, while the mucosal healing phase in the animals was impaired (Naito et al. 2004; Gay et al. 2006). These findings suggest that targeting IL-6 may affect and disrupt the mucosal healing stage during recovery (Fattori et al. 1994; Tebbutt et al. 2002). As a result, optimizing therapeutic methods based on inhibition of IL-6 in the stages of hyperinflammation where IL-6 production is dysregulated, and selective induction of IL-6 in the mucosal healing stage can be useful in the treatment of IBD (Choi et al. 2015). However, the diagnosis of these stages and treatment optimization need more studies. In this section, according to the purpose of the study, IL-6/IL-6R axis inhibitors and their effect on the treatment of IBD and CAC are investigated.

# Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory agents used to induce remission in UC patients and can inhibit inflammatory transcription factors such as activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NFKB and repress the release of IL-1 and IL-6 (Oakley and Cidlowski 2013; Rezaie et al. 2015). A double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study used beclomethasone dipropionate and prednisone in patients with mild-to-moderate UC, and the findings demonstrated promising clinical outcomes with a respectable safety profile (Assche et al. 2015).

However, some patients become resistant to corticosteroid therapy, and the treatment fails. In this type of patient, administering intravenous infliximab (a chimeric, IgG-1 monoclonal anti-TNF-α antibody) can be useful in patients with moderate to severe DC and UC as well as patients with corticosteroid-refractory acute UC (Hanauer et al. 2002; Rutgeerts et al. 2005; Kevans et al. 2018). As mentioned, TNF-α induces the production of IL-6 by macrophages, and treatment with infliximab may indirectly control the overproduction of IL-6 (McGee et al. 1995). Fascinatingly, soluble gp130 may act as a natural inhibitor of IL-6 in IBD, which may be due to the IL-6 co-elution of IL-6 with soluble gp130. Moreover, soluble gp130, the serum levels are elevated in UC and to a lesser extent in CD than in healthy subjects (Mitsuyama et al. 2006).

Antibodies blocking the IL-6/IL-6R axis include tocilizumab, clazakizumab, olokizumab, PF-04236921, Clazakizumab (BMS-945429), C326, and other inhibitors may be effective in the treatment of IBD. Although some of these inhibitors have entered phases I and II of clinical trials, these studies were incomplete or terminated for various reasons. Among these drugs, tocilizumab and PF-04236921 are well-studied IL-6/IL-6R axis inhibitors in IBD (Coskun et al. 2017). Tocilizumab is a human anti-IL-6R antibody that was first used in 2004 in a phase I clinical trial on CD patients, but although patients well-tolerated tocilizumab, only 20% of patients attained clinical remission, and no difference was observed between the findings of endoscopy or histology in patients treated with tocilizumab and placebo (Ito et al. 2004).

A study on a T cell transfer murine colitis model demonstrated that blocking the IL-6/IL-6R axis signals with tocilizumab reduced lamina propria T cells apoptosis, repressed the expression of vascular adhesion molecules, and effectively decreased intestinal inflammation (Ito 2005). To evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab, the researchers of this study performed a clinical trial in patients with CD. The outcomes showed that 12 weeks of administration of tocilizumab (dose of 8 mg/kg) could significantly increase the clinical response rate in 80% of undertreatment CD patients. This dose of tocilizumab was safe and well-tolerated by patients.

Moreover, remission was observed in 20% of CD patients treated with tocilizumab disease, and the acute-phase responses were regularized (Ito 2005). Despite the therapeutic benefits of tocilizumab in IBD, there are reports of challenges and limitations in using this drug. In this context, some investigations have reported that tocilizumab may exacerbate pre-existing UC or cause de novo drug-induced IBD, which may be due to the inability to suppress IL-6 production in the inflamed gut (Borghini et al. 2021). Additionally, tocilizumab can lead to severe colitis in patients with Takayasu arteritis. A recent study reported bacteremia, colonic perforation, and wide lesions in the sigmoid colon were detected in some patients with Takayasu arteritis under treatment with tocilizumab (Ishii et al. 2022). Since IL-6 plays a significant role in intestinal biological processes such as recovery from ischemic injury and infection control, inhibition of IL-6R with tocilizumab may be associated with adverse effects such as infection, and this is one of the major challenges in utilizing this inhibitor in the treatment of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases such as Takayasu arteritis and IBD.

A fully human anti-IL-6 mAb termed PF-04236921 is used in a phase I clinical trial conducted on patients with CD who failed anti-TNF therapy (NCT01345318). The outcomes of this study showed that PF-04236921 induced clinical response and remission in refractory patients with CD (Danese et al. 2019). Nevertheless, perforation and gastrointestinal abscesses were detected as adverse effects of PF-04236921 therapy, which may be due to the restorative role of IL-6/IL-6R signals in IEC. Clazakizumab is a fully-humanized mAb that is able to inhibit free IL-6 and IL-6/sIL-6R complex (Semerano et al. 2014; Rossi et al. 2015a, b). A phase II trial (NCT01545050) was designed to evaluate the efficacy of Clazakizumab in patients with moderate to severe CD who had an unsatisfactory response to conventional therapy or failed anti-TNF therapy (Rogler 2015). However, more information about this study is unavailable.
