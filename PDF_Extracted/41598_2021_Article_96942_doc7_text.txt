With increasing numbers of publicly available genomes and improvements in the resolution of 16S rRNA sequencing through ASV approaches, the accuracy of this approach has improved, and it does allow us to explore potential differences which are present due to changes in taxonomic composition 20. Using this approach, it was clear that the microbiomes of the three disease conditions, and of the three CD locations, all had unique dysbioses with some unifying themes. For example, all CD patients were observed to be significantly deficient in pathways for the production of SCFAs that have a myriad of important functions relating to immune function and gut health 35–41. SCFAs are imperative to intestinal homeostasis: providing a key energy source for colonocytes, maintenance of hypoxia, production of antimicrobial compounds, and promotion of anti-inflammatory cytokines 35–41. The loss of the ability to produce SFCAs by the gut microbiome in CD patients could lead to inflammation and reduced cellular membrane integrity giving a mechanism for disease microbiome and disease severity as previously reported 10. Future work is needed to understand whether these patterns hold for patients with more progressed disease and the way that disease severity changes the microbiome for different IBD conditions and disease locations.

# Conclusion

This study suggests the microbiome does not uniformly present in the same way for all IBD conditions and that the microbiome can even present differently for the same disease at a different GI location. Results here highlight the importance of understanding the different factors that can influence the results of microbiome studies. Consistent stratification of clinical cohorts used in microbiome studies is required to ensure the meaningful comparison of microbiome studies and clinical trials.
