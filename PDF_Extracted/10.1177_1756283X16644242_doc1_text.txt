The tripartite pathophysiological circuit of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The microbiome, barrier function, and immune system all play critical roles in IBD pathophysiology with eubiosis, mucosal integrity and tolerance seen in health and dysbiosis, leaky gut, and inflammation seen in disease. Risk factors (environmental and genetic) push these pathophysiological components in the direction of disease. Therapeutic targets (microbiome, barrier function, and immune system based) push the components in the direction of health.

In this review, we discuss these factors with a focus on the microbiome and barrier function. While most current therapies modulate inflammation, we highlight new microbiome and barrier function based therapies under investigation for IBD.

# The gastrointestinal microbiome

New research tools employed by initiatives like the Human Microbiome [Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012; Integrative HMP (iHMP) Research Network Consortium, 2014] and metagenomics of the human intestinal tract (MetaHIT) [Arumugam et al. 2011] have led to rapid advances in our understanding of the microbes present on and within our body. These microbes are collectively referred to as the microbiota and the complement of their genomic content is termed the microbiome [Ursell et al. 2012].

Massively parallel deep sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA and yeast 18S ribosomal RNA has allowed taxonomic categorization of the microbiota without the need to grow individual organisms, the majority of which remain uncultured [Rajilic-Stojanovic et al. 2007; Hamady and Knight, 2009; Metzker, 2010]. Metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics have helped us understand the metabolic pathways present within the microbiome [Lepage et al. 2013]. Model systems like gnotobiotic mice [Faith et al. 2010] and ex vivo systems [Roeselers et al. 2013] are allowing us to investigate host microbe interactions and understand the contributions of isolated microbes.

Within the gastrointestinal tract, the microbiota varies lengthwise (mouth to rectum) and cross sectionally (lumen to mucosa) [Eckburg et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2005]. It contains all divisions of life: archaea, prokarya, eukarya (mostly fungi) as well as viruses (mostly bacteriophage) [Ley et al. 2006; Scanlan and Marchesi, 2008; Ianiro et al. 2014; Scarpellini et al. 2015]. The majority of studies to date have focused on the 10–100 trillion bacterial cells present throughout the gastrointestinal tract [Eckburg et al. 2005]. Ninety percent of the bacteria fall into the two phyla: Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes [Eckburg et al. 2005]. Other phyla, including Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, are also present in lower quantities [Eckburg et al. 2005]. Diversity estimates place the total number of species between 1000 and 5000 [Zoetendal et al. 2008], and only a fraction of these, the ‘core’ microbiota, are commonly present in most individuals [Turnbaugh et al. 2009; Sekelja et al. 2011]. Individual microbiomes have been classified into different enterotypes (or faecotypes) [Arumugam et al. 2011; Jeffery et al. 2012], characterized by predominant species and metabolic pathways that correlate with long-term dietary preferences (high protein and animal fat versus high carbohydrate) [Wu et al. 2011].

The intestinal microbiome is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors [Spor et al. 2011]. Interestingly, the microbiomes of monozygotic twin pairs are more similar than mother–child pairs, which are more similar than unrelated pairs irrespective of physical separation [Turnbaugh et al. 2009]. From the time of birth, environmental factors like mode of delivery (cesarean section versus vaginal) and feeding preference (breast feeding versus formula feeding) shape the gut microbiome [Penders et al. 2006; Fallani et al. 2010]. This microbiome is highly dynamic in the first year of life with relative stabilization in the transition to an adult diet [Koenig et al. 2011]. Short- and long-term food preferences including vegetarian versus meat-based diets have significant effects on the microbiome [Wu et al. 2011; David et al. 2014]. Environmental factors such as level of hygiene, exposure to infections, antibiotics, and other drugs can also modify the microbiome [Spor et al. 2011].

In health, the microbiome plays key roles in metabolism of food and drugs, development of
