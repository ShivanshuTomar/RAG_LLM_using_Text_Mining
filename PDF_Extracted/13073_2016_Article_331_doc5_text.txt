# Results

A control (p = 0.00001) and 0.72 lower on average (p = 0.007) relative to controls. Patients with UC had Shannon values 1.31 lower at baseline (p = 8E-05) and 0.98 lower on average (p = 0.002).

Our sample of patients with IBD also had significantly higher scores on the dysbiosis index than controls. At baseline, the mean control dysbiosis index was –1.85 ± 0.55. Baseline dysbiosis was 0.86 point higher for CD patients (p = 6E-8) and 1.75 points higher for those with UC (p = 4E-15). Dysbiosis scores were on average 0.67 point higher in CD (p = 3E-07) and 1.38 points higher in UC (p = 3E-10). Our microbiome findings of decreased Shannon diversity and increased dysbiosis did not change when we calculated these values after de novo OTU picking or after taking the median of 10,000 rarefactions to the lowest sequencing depth seen in our closed biom table (see Additional file 3 for a comparison of these approaches to results of our original closed-reference OTU approach).

Patients with UC had significantly higher calprotectin and dysbiosis indices than those with CD (Fig. 2, Additional file 2: Table S4). UC patients also had fecal calprotectin levels 829 μg/g higher at baseline (p = 2E-05) and 917 μg/g higher on average (6E-06) compared to CD patients. The dysbiosis index was 0.49 point higher among UC patients at baseline (p = 0.02) and 0.70 point higher on average (0.0007) than in CD patients. While the Shannon diversity was lower in our patients with UC, this difference was not significant, possibly due to the relatively small sample size of our cohort.

Our longitudinal samples also show improvements in outcome measures over time for IBD patients (Fig. 2), reflecting overall response to treatment, while these measures did not significantly change for controls over the course of the study (Additional file 2: Table S3). Calprotectin declined in patients with CD relative to controls (p = 0.02), and in those with UC, calprotectin declined at around four times the rate of CD compared to controls (p = 3E-06). An increase in Shannon diversity relative to controls was not significant for CD patients, but Shannon diversity did improve over the course of the study for patients with UC compared to controls (p = 0.002).

Both CD and UC patients showed improvements (decreases) in the microbial dysbiosis index compared to controls (p = 0.03 and p = 1E-13, respectively), with UC patients having a higher comparative rate of decline. Over the entire course of our study, the average difference in fecal calprotectin for CD and UC patients compared to controls was 181 μg/g (p = 0.00002) and 1100 μg/g (p = 4E-10), respectively. As seen in previous studies, patients with IBD had overall lower alpha diversity as measured by the Shannon index. The Shannon index at baseline for controls was 6.02 ± 0.58. Patients with CD had Shannon index values 0.94 lower at baseline.

# Dysbiosis associates significantly with clinical and biological measures of disease severity

Our next aim was to test whether dysbiosis showed an association with calprotectin in our cohort. Using GEE, we found that higher dysbiosis associated significantly with higher calprotectin (Additional file 2: Table S5).
