# Authors’ contributions

MB, TH, CS, RJX, and SK conceptualized the study; ADK, GAS, and JGM provided the methodology, KAS, PC, and TV the formal analysis, KAS, PC, and TV the investigation, and MB, TH, JP, AK, and SK the resources. KAS, MB, TH, PC, ADK, TV, JP, AK, JGM, and SK wrote the original draft, and all authors reviewed and edited it. KAS, TV, and AS provided visualization, JGM, RJX, and SK supervision, and SK funding acquisition. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

# Conclusions

New findings

- Markers of inflammation and dysbiosis are increased in IBD; microbial dysbiosis improves over time but persists despite cessation of clinical disease activity and mucosal healing among responders.
- The dysbiosis index does associate with calprotectin, a measure of inflammation, but it does not distinguish treatment responders (those with mucosal healing) from non-responders.
- Other microbiome signatures do emerge at the genus level and warrant further investigation.

# Impact on clinical practice

- Treatment-naïve analysis of the microbiome could potentially be used to predict whether a subject will respond to treatment.
- Sustained and deep remission may require normalizing the gut dysbiosis.
