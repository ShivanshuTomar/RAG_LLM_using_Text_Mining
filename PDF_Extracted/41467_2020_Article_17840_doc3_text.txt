# Fig. 3 Differential and cohort-specific microbial co-abundances.

a Differential species co-abundances involved in 45 microbial genera.

b Differential pathway co-abundances involved in 41 microbial metabolic categories. Each dot indicates one microbial genus or metabolic category. Each line represents differential species or pathway co-abundances between species or pathways from either the same or different genera or metabolic categories. The width and darkness of the lines represent the relative number of differential co-abundances.

[inflammation (n = 121) vs. no inflammation (n = 377)] (Supplementary Table 1). Most of the co-abundance relationships were comparable between disease characteristics, and only a few showed significant differences at FDR < 0.05 (Supplementary Fig. 7, Supplementary Data 9 and 10), namely 16 species co-abundances related to disease subtypes and 8 species co-abundances related to location. For the pathway co-abundances, 91 were related to disease subtypes, 24 to location and 3 to activity (Cochran-Q test FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 7). Out of these, five co-abundance relationships were related to an important butyrate producer, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which showed stronger co-abundance relationships in UC compared to CD. One example here was the negative co-abundance relationship of prausnitzii with Haemophilus parainfluenzae, a species known to have pathogenic properties.

Microbial networks of IBD in relation to medication: We further tested whether drug usage can affect microbial co-abundance, as usage of antibiotics (20.0%) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs; 26.5%) was higher in patients with IBD than in the general population cohorts (1.1% and 8.4%) (Supplementary Table 1). Here we detected no significant difference in species co-abundances between antibiotic users and non-users (Cochran-Q test FDR > 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 7), while 1049 out of 37,959 (3.7%) pathway co-abundance relationships showed statistically significant differences between PPI users and non-users, in particular related to the isoprene biosynthesis and methylerythritol phosphate pathways (Cochran-Q test FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. 7, Supplementary Data 10).

Key species and pathways in IBD: When comparing microbial co-abundance in IBD to the other 3 cohorts, we identified 113 species co-abundances and 1050 pathway co-abundances that showed significantly different effects compared to the other 3 cohorts. We then assessed whether these IBD-specific co-abundances were highly connected to a specific pathway or species that may be disease relevant, and our analysis identified three key species and four key pathways for IBD.

Key species included Escherichia coli, Oxalobacter formigenes and Actinomyces graevenitzii. E. coli has been associated with IBD, O. formigenes have previously been identified.
