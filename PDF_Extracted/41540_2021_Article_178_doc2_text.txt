# Metabolite Secretion and Uptake in Dysbiotic Microbiomes

Potential to take up and secrete metabolites (Supplementary Table 1). Of the maximally possible 419 metabolites, 143 could be secreted into the faecal compartment by at least one microbiome but were not taken up, i.e., they were of microbial origin but not dietary. Another 59 metabolites could only be taken up by at least one microbiome and were thus only present in the simulated diet. Finally, further 86 metabolites were both taken up and secreted meaning they were both dietary and microbial of origin. The remaining 131 metabolites that could be neither taken up nor secreted either lacked the necessary biosynthesis precursors in the given dietary input or were dead-end metabolites, i.e., metabolites that only be consumed or produced, in the corresponding AGORA reconstructions. Some qualitative metabolite biosynthesis capacities were present in almost all microbiomes metabolite while others were rare (Supplementary Table 1). Taken together, the systematic in silico metabolic profiling predicted that the analysed microbiomes could convert the dietary inputs into a variety of metabolites from diverse subsystems.

# Distinct Metabolite Uptake and Secretion Potential in Dysbiotic Compared with Non-Dysbiotic Microbiomes

Since the microbial composition of the dysbiotic and non-dysbiotic individuals clearly differed, we expected these differences to be reflected in the predicted metabolic profiles. We performed a statistical analysis (Methods) of the predicted uptake and secretion fluxes reported in Supplementary Tables 2–3. Of the 229 metabolites that were produced by at least one microbiome, 44 differed statistically significantly between the microbiomes of IBD patients and healthy controls (Wilcoxon rank sum test corrected for false discovery rate, Supplementary Table 4a). Moreover, 122 metabolites had statistically significantly different production potential in the dysbiotic compared with the non-dysbiotic IBD cluster (Supplementary Table 4b). Overall, the production potential for 139 metabolites differed between at least two of the three groups (Supplementary Table 4a, b). The clearer separation between the dysbiotic and non-dysbiotic IBD cluster than between healthy and IBD was in line with our expectations as the modelling framework was personalised with only the individuals’ gut microbial compositions and did not account for other factors (e.g., human metabolism and non-microbiome-mediated effects of medication). Taken together, dysbiotic IBD microbiomes were distinct in metabolite secretion potential as a direct consequence of their distinct microbial compositions.

The dysbiotic IBD microbiomes were depleted in the production potential for metabolites involved in glycan degradation, fermentation, and B-vitamin biosynthesis (Fig. 2a–f). Metabolites with increased production potential in the dysbiotic cluster belonged mainly to the subsystems of amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle, simple sugars, and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2a–f). For instance, we predicted an increased secretion potential in the dysbiotic cluster for lactate, glycine, betaine, hydrogen sulfide, ethanol, putrescine, and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) (Fig. 2a–f and Supplementary Table 4b). Increased faecal lactate and putrescine have been reported for Crohn’s Disease patients.

Hydrogen sulfide has been proposed to both worsen and protect gastrointestinal inflammation. On the other hand, a reduced secretion potential was predicted for branched-chain fatty acids, nicotinamide (vitamin B3), and degradation products of mucins and other glycans (Fig. 2a–f and Supplementary Table 4b). Reduced faecal isovalerate has been observed in IBD. Decreased vitamin B3 levels have also been reported for IBD patients. Riboflavin and reduced riboflavin biosynthesis were decreased in IBD microbiomes compared with healthy (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 4a). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which is well known to be depleted in Crohn’s Disease patients, uses riboflavin as a redox mediator in an extracellular electron shuttle explaining the decreased riboflavin reduction. A Random forests fluxes in MetaboAnalyst analysis was performed on the metabolite secretion with an out-of-bag (OOB) error of 0.0648. Among the secreted metabolites that best stratified the non-dysbiotic and dysbiotic microbiomes were chorismate, D-ribose, L-lactate, and phenol (Fig. 2g).

To link the predicted metabolite secretion potential to specific microbes, we calculated the Spearman correlation between metabolite secretion and uptake potential and species abundances. Strong correlations (>0.75) between species and metabolites were found for 66 secreted metabolites. For instance, glycan degradation products strongly correlated with several Bacteroides spp., in agreement with Bacteroides being known species known to biotransform bile acids as observed previously. As expected, methane correlated positively with Methanobrevibacter smithii and Clostridioides difficile correlated with the known p-cresol producer. The remaining 163 secreted metabolites did not strongly correlate with specific species. Thus, the uptake and production of these metabolites was carried out by a combination of multiple taxa.

# Absolute and Quantitative Presence of Metabolic Functions is Altered in Dysbiotic Microbiomes

To explain the observed changes in metabolite secretion potential, we calculated and inspected the absolute presence of reactions in the microbiomes, as well as the quantitative reaction abundances on the whole community, class, and genus level. The absolute presence of 84 and 393 reactions was distinct between healthy and IBD and between the dysbiotic and non-dysbiotic IBD cluster, respectively. Thus, the dysbiotic IBD microbiomes were depleted or enriched in the absolute presence of certain pathways. Specifically, reactions involved in glycan degradation were absent in most dysbiotic microbiomes.

The abundances of 460 reactions on the total community level, 868 reactions on the phylum level, and 37,059 reactions on the genus level differed significantly between healthy controls and IBD patients. Moreover, 1397 reactions on the total community level, 5443 reactions on the phylum level, and 49,376 reactions on the genus level were different in abundance between the dysbiotic and non-dysbiotic IBD cluster. The abundances of complete pathways were distinct between groups. For instance, amino acid biosynthesis and lipid metabolism pathways had higher abundances in the dysbiotic cluster. Taken together, the microbiomes of dysbiotic IBD patients were distinct in the qualitative and quantitative presence of key reactions and pathways, which explains their aforementioned altered potential to consume and secrete metabolites.

# IBD Microbiomes Exhibit Reduced Metabolic Diversity and Altered Sulfur Secretion Patterns

We hypothesised that the reduced species diversity in the IBD microbiomes with dysbiosis would also translate into reduced metabolic diversity and in a reduced number of secreted compounds. Thus, we further analysed the qualitative metabolic potential per microbiome discussed above. Indeed, the number of compounds that could be theoretically secreted by each microbiome was highly dependent on the number of strains found in the stool samples, showing a logarithmic dependency. Additionally, the metabolic diversity in dysbiotic IBD was more restricted as predicted from the loss in microbial diversity alone.
