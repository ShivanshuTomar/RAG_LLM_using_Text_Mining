Differences in taxa abundance in response to cART in IL-10 − / − vs. SvEv WT. Comparisons between animals in the placebo and cART groups show that the abundance of some taxa was significantly different in A the colitis model IL-10 − / − but not B the SvEv wild type. (Left panels show differential abundance analyses with the package DESeq2; red and green dots represent taxa with increased or decreased abundance, respectively, in the ART group when compared against placebo, and only taxa with a fold change difference of 2 or more are shown. Right panels represent the first and second components of a principal coordinate analysis using Bray–Curtis distances; number of animals in the placebo and antiviral therapy groups, respectively, were IL10 − / − : n = 19 and n = 21; SvEv: n = 9 and n = 8)

fashion [14]. In this study, identification of the relevant vSAG was not straightforward because different MMTV sag genes were identified in the IL10−/− lactoserum con- tigs (Table 2; mtv-3 specific for TCR-Vβ3, TCR-Vβ5, and TCR-Vβ17 and mtv-17 of unknown specificity [14]). Ultimately, the vSAG present in infected tissue dictates specificity, and a vSAG9 effect was observed with more than a twofold increase of the cognate TCR-Vβ5 and TCR-Vβ12 subsets in the IL10−/− colon.

Other features consistent with MMTV infection pathogenesis with TCR-Vβ skewing and evidence of vSAG activity have been previously observed in the IL-10−/− model. For example, a marked expansion of the colon CD4 + T-cell population is found in the IL-10−/− mouse leading to a reversal of the CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio found in WT mice [18]. The vSAG activation of CD4 + lymphocytes leads to a progressive increase in cognate TCR-Vβ Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Treg) in Peyer’s patches, and these MMTV-infected Treg have the ability to preferentially suppress the proliferative response of T cells ex vivo in wild-type mice [32].

Our findings may be clinically relevant as vSAG activity has been suggested as a potential mechanism in CD and idiopathic inflammatory diseases without further identification of a viral superantigen to better delineate cognate TCR-Vβ skewing. With regard to the predominance of CD4+ lymphocytes in Crohn disease, the observation that human immunodeficiency virus is linked with decreased disease severity in patients with IBD has seeded the idea of the “remission theory,” which suggests
