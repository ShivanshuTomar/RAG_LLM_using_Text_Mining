Construction of an interaction network among shared specific gene associated with the gut microbiome in RA, genes related to shared pathways identified via GSEA, and the RA-specific gut microbiome.

(A) Interaction network of shared specific gene and metabolites associated with the gut microbiome in RA; CXCL10 was directly associated with the metabolites.

(B) Venn diagram demonstrating 7 shared high-expression pathways associated with RA and IBD identified via GSEA.

(C) Venn diagram demonstrating 18 common genes associated with the 7 pathways.

(D) An interaction network between the shared specific gene associated with the gut microbiome in RA, shared pathways via GSEA, genes related to shared pathways identified via GSEA, and the RA-specific gut microbiome.
