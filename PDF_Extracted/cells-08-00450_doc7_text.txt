# 6.1. GPCRs for Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)

GPR41. GPR41 is mainly activated by propionate, acetate, caproate, butyrate, and valerate to a lesser degree [85]. Activation of this receptor leads to intracellular Ca2+ release and reduction of cAMP [86]. Studies reported that GPR41 is expressed in the colonic epithelium [85, 87], and also in spleen and the pancreas at low levels. In adipocytes, the expression of GPR41 remains controversial. In animals, activation of GPR41 by propionate leads to altered bone marrow hematopoiesis with affected Th2 cell development in models of allergic disease [88]. GPR41 also regulates blood pressure through renin release. In murine intestinal epithelial cells, the activation of GPR41 induced the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and production of chemokines and cytokines. These pathways mediate protective immunity and tissue inflammation [89].

GPR43. Acetate and propionate are fermentation products of anaerobic bacteria in the gut, and both have equal affinity for GPR43. In vitro activation of GPR43 induces the release of Ca2+ intracellularly and reduces cAMP in the colon epithelium [85,90]. Human neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, intestinal epithelial cells express GPR43 [90–93]. Signaling via GPR43 downregulates inflammatory responses. Genetic ablation of GPR43 in mice promotes allergic airway disease. Further analysis showed that GPR43 also suppresses insulin-mediated fat accumulation in adipose tissues [94]. Additionally, the absence of GPR43 impairs β cell proliferation leading to loss of glucose tolerance and impaired insulin secretion [95]. Recently, Kim and co-workers demonstrated that deficient GPR43 mice were defective in mounting appropriate immune responses to promote barrier immunity, and develop uncontrolled chronic inflammations following epithelial damage [96].

GPR109A and GPR109B. Although niacin was identified as the first GPR109A agonist, later studies demonstrated that the SCFA butyrate might be more biologically relevant for this receptor, in the gut, where the level of butyrate is sufficiently high. However, in the periphery, butyrate is present at a lower level than in the gut, which would question the relevance of this agonist. GPR109A is detectable on macrophages, neutrophils, and adipocytes. Additionally, in mice, GPR109A is expressed in the small and large intestine and broadly in the spleen and bone marrow. Activation of GPR109A by niacin reduces the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, monocytes, and epithelial cells [97–99]. In mice that lack GPR190A, the nicotinic acid-induced decrease in free fatty acid and triglyceride plasma levels was abrogated, indicating that GPR190A mediates the anti-lipolytic and lipid-lowering effects of nicotinic acid in vivo [100]. Moreover, GPR109A knock-out mice are characterized by an inflammation in the DSS-induced colitis model [51,57].

Although GPR109B and GPR109A share high homology, GPR109B and GPR109A do not share the same ligand niacin. D-tryptophan and the essential amino acid D-phenylalanine can bind to GPR109B [101]. Like GPR109A, GPR109B appears to play a role in the immune system. Indeed, aromatic D-amino acids elicit a chemotactic response in human neutrophils via activation of GPR109B [101]. Additionally, data shows that the 3-OH-octanoic acid and GPR109B mediate a negative feedback regulation of adipocyte lipolysis [102].

# 6.2. GPCRs for Medium and Long Chain Fatty Acid (MCFA, LCFA)

GPR40. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with a chain length of C8–C22 [103] activate GPR40, which is predominately expressed in the pancreas and the liver [103]. Moreover immune cells, taste buds, and the central nervous system also express GPR40 [104–106]. Fatty acid binding to GPR40 appears to activate the Gαq/11-protein complex, resulting in the activation of phospholipase C. Activation of GPR40 plays an essential role in the regulation of insulin secretion. However, experiments on the function of this receptor have produced conflicting data. In vitro, the reduction of GPR40 expression by siRNA in β cell lines or isolated mouse islets reduced fatty acid augmentation of insulin secretion [107,108]. Comparable results have been observed in GPR40−/− mice [109,110]. Conversely, overexpression of GPR40 in pancreatic β cells augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and improved glucose tolerance in normal and diabetic mice [111]. In the mouse gut,
