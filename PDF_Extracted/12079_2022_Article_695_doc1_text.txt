# Biology and signaling of the IL‑6/IL-6R axis

Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a glycosylated protein, comprises 184 amino acids. This cytokine can produce and release by various immune and non-immune cells such as T cells, monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts (Schaper and Rose-John 2015). The receptor of IL-6 is IL-6R with a size of 80 kDa and belongs to the type I transmembrane proteins (Yamasaki et al. 1988). As a second transmembrane protein signal transducer, the dimerization of glycoprotein 130 (gp130, CD130) is essential for the IL-6/

# Inflammatory bowel disease

IBD is mainly employed to define two long-range pathologic conditions, UC and DC, characterized by gut inflammation (Glassner et al. 2020). Basically, UC only affects the colon or large intestine, while CD can influence any part of the digestive system, from the anus to the mouth. People of all ages are usually susceptible to IBD, but it has been reported most often between the ages of 15 and 40. The symptoms of IBD include weight loss, abdominal pain, swelling or cramps in the tummy, bloody or recurring diarrhea, and tiredness (Inflammatory bowel disease 2022). Furthermore, severe symptoms such as vomiting, anemia, and high temperature may occur in some patients. It has been reported that uveitis, arthritis, erythema nodosum and jaundice are less commonly IBD-associated symptoms. IBD symptoms can fluctuate; for example, these symptoms may be severe at times (flare-up) or may occur little or not at all over long periods (remission) (Inflammatory bowel disease 2022).

It is unknown what causes IBD, but based on information from patients and their records, a combination of factors, including environmental factors, genetics, immune system disorders, and smoking, increases the risk of developing IBD (Molodecky and Kaplan 2010; Ananthakrishnan 2015).

To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no cure for UC and DC. Existing treatments include lifestyle changes, specific diets, surgery, and medications generally used to relieve IBD symptoms and prevent recurring symptoms (Nakase et al. 2021). Medications used to treat CD or UC include anti-inflammatory drugs (aminosalicylates or mesalazines), immunosuppressive drugs (steroids and azathioprine), biological and biosimilar medicines (monoclonal antibodies [mAb] and antagonist inhibitors). However, 1 in 5 UC patients do not respond to these treatments, and surgery should be performed to remove the inflamed tissue in the severe stages of the disease. These patients are also prone to gastrointestinal cancers, especially colorectal cancer (CRC), and should periodically undergo endoscopy and other screening tests (Clarke and Feuerstein 2019).

Evidence shows that the risk of CRC is 2- to 3-fold higher in IBD patients and the severity, extent and persistence of the inflammatory responses are principally responsible for CRC development in patients with IBD (Fantini and Guadagni 2021). Patients with IBD and CRC have been documented to have a worse prognosis than those without a history of IBD, so the effectiveness of existing treatments for IBD can reduce the chance of colitis-associated cancer (CAC). According to existing studies, chronic intestinal inflammation increases the risk of developing CAC in UC and CD, and controlling inflammation can be imperative in preventing CAC (Fantini and Guadagni 2021).

# Current Understanding of IL-6 in IBD

and chemokine receptor C–C motif chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) all of which initiate inflammatory responses by inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-18 (Ahluwalia et al. 2018). Among these cytokines, IL-6, as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, could mediate various physiologic and pathologic phenomena (Mihara et al. 2012). It has been well-documented that IL-6 contributes to the differentiation of T helper 17 (Th17) (Kimura and Kishimoto 2010). Th17, along with Th1, are involved in the pathogenesis of IBD (Lavoie et al. 2019; Kojima et al. 2022). In CD and UC, the persistence of CD4 + T cells at the site of inflammation is censoriously dependent on the antiapoptotic IL-6/IL-6R/STAT3 axis signals, inducing the expression of BCL2 and BCLxL. Accumulating apoptosis-resistance T cells in this milieu leads to chronic inflammation (Mudter and Neurath 2007).

Evidence revealed an association between the gut microbiome and the immune system (Smith et al. 2019). The fermenting bacteria metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA), butyrate, and acetate inhibit the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and interact with regulatory B and T cells to ameliorate colitis (Smith et al. 2013). On the other hand, the gut microbiota can stimulate macrophages and DCs to release IL-1β and IL-6, leading to Th17 differentiation (Wu et al. 2010; Rosser et al. 2014). Furthermore, indole, another bacterial metabolite, induces the expression of IL-22, producing anti-microbial peptides and protecting the intestine against pathogens damage (Zelante et al. 2013). Therefore, the gut microbiome is involved in proinflammatory and regulatory responses (Federico et al. 2009; Rosser et al. 2014). Consequently, manipulating the gut microbiome and its-induced IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic purpose for treating IBD (Ahluwalia et al. 2018; Kang et al. 2019).

This review highlights the role of the gut microbiome in regulating the IL-6/IL-6R axis in IBD. Additionally, the targeted therapy of the IL-6/IL-6R axis in IBD and the reasons for the failure of this therapeutic approach have been investigated.
