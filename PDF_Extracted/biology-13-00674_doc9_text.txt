# 5.1. Dietary Therapies for IBD

Given the previously cited data, it is reasonable to assume that dietary practices have a significant impact on the gut microbiome’s makeup and, subsequently, influence the progression of IBD. This finding supports the theory that dietary modification could be a practical means for treating IBD. Furthermore, Hashash JG et al. provided the best dietary advice for people with IBD in a study on nutritional and dietary therapies for patients.

Additionally, a high salt concentration has also been observed to promote IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) expression in naïve T cells by a mechanism involving the SGK1, establishing that the IL-23/IL-23R axis plays a pivotal role in the differentiation of pathogenic inflammatory Th17 cells. Furthermore, an increase in dietary salt levels has been demonstrated to induce a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype in human and murine macrophages. These M1 macrophages are in charge of producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12, IL-23, and IL-1β. This leads to the augmentation of Th1- and Th17-cell-mediated immune responses, which, in turn, exacerbates the damage to the intestinal epithelium. In conclusion, it can be stated that a diet high in salt affects the immune homeostasis of the gut. This effect is not a direct cause of IBD, but it is one of the causative factors involved in IBD. This effect may not only be direct, affecting the intestinal cells, but also indirect, through the action of certain cytokines that increase the percentage of Th17 cells and promote inflammation.

In addition to stimulating Th17 and Treg cells and the associated activation of the Th17 cell pathway, a substantial body of evidence from a range of studies indicates that a high-salt diet can also promote inflammation via other immune cells and pro-inflammatory factors. For instance, Qi et al. recently demonstrated that a diet high in salt can also accelerate the progression of IBD by promoting RIPK3-dependent necrotic apoptosis in mouse colonic epithelial cells when compared with those who consuming a normal or low salt diet. Similarly, given the role of IL-17 cytokines in colonic epithelial cells following injury, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that an excessive salt intake in the diet not only causes the damage and death of intestinal epithelial cells, but also increases Th17 cells and IL-17 cytokines, thereby exacerbating the inflammatory response at the site of loss and, in turn, contributing to the development of inflammatory diseases of the intestinal tract.

Furthermore, an additional study demonstrated that diets high in sodium chloride influence the mucosal immunity of both the colon and, to a lesser degree, the small intestine. This effect is observed through the enhancement of the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including Rac1, Map2k1, Map2k6, and Atf2. Conversely, the expression of numerous cytokines and chemokines is suppressed, including Ccl3, Ccl4, Cxcl2, Cxcr4, and Ccr7. Liao Y et al. demonstrated that the transient intake of high levels of salt was observed to elevate histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) at the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) subunit p65 promoter in rats exhibiting sensitivity to salt. This promoted the transcription of the p65 gene and the subsequent activation of NF-κB, which, in turn, gave rise to a cascade of inflammatory responses in salt-sensitive hypertension. It has been demonstrated that the transcription factor NF-κB plays a crucial role in regulating dysregulated cytokine secretion and signaling mechanisms in intestinal epithelial cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages. Furthermore, NF-κB-p65, which is present in macrophages and epithelial cells isolated from inflamed intestinal samples from IBD patients, has been shown to enhance this process. These findings collectively highlight the complex interplay between dietary salt intake and the intestinal immune system. It seems reasonable to posit that a diet high in salt may exert an influence on the pathogenesis of IBD by affecting this epigenetic change to promote the expression of particular genes.

To conclude, the available evidence suggests that a high intake of salt or sodium can have a direct effect on the immune system balance within the gut, potentially leading to the development of IBD via various routes.
