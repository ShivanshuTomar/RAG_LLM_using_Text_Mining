# Figure 4 Top gene-bacteria associations

Beeswarm plots of the relative abundance of six bacteria stratified by the number of risk alleles present in SNPs in the given genes. The associations shown are the six most significant associations between bacteria and genes in the subset of genes with conserved bacterial associations across cohorts and belonging to the JAK-STAT pathway or the innate immune pathway response as shown in Figure 3. Relative abundances shown are transformed with the arcsine-square root transformation to stabilize variance and to make distributions more normal.

# Effects of Cohort Membership

Cohort membership had similarly broad effects; age, gender, and disease phenotype had measurable, although less broad, effects; genotype, as represented by the NOD2 subtype, had a modest effect in relation to other factors. Inflammatory status of the biopsied tissue was associated with increased relative abundance of unclassified members of Lactobacillus, and with decreased relative abundance of Bacteroides unifor-mis (Figure S5 in Additional file 1). This analysis demonstrates the comprehensive and intermingled effects of treatment history, gastrointestinal biogeography, and other host and environmental factors on gut microbiome profile and makes clear the need to account for host factors when linking host genotype to microbial composition in a phenotypically heterogeneous population.

We confirmed that host genetics as a whole do have a significant effect on microbiome profile by correlating overall between-subject genetic distance (Manhattan distance) with overall between-subject microbiome (P < 5.0 × 10-10; Figure S6 in Additional file 1), but that it is only a minor contributor in the context of other sources of variation. A recent study of treatment-naïve pediatric patients with CD identified consistent microbiome shifts in patients with recent antibiotic exposure toward the disease-related state [20]. That study exemplified the need to control for the potentially confounding effects of antibiotics when attempting to identify bacterial profiles associated with disease. Based on several studies linking short- and long-term dietary exposure to microbiome profile, it is also likely to be useful to include food intake diaries or dietary recall questionnaires in future genotype-microbiome research [39,40].

# Antibiotics contribute to IBD dysbiosis independent of NOD2 effects

The fact that host genetics are a minor contributor to overall microbiome composition relative to environmental factors does not exclude the possibility that genotype-microbiome interactions play an important role in the etiology of IBD; it is possible that the important variations are in a particular set of taxa or a particular set of functions (for example, resistance to oxidative stress) that make up a minor portion of the overall microbiome, while there are other taxa not closely related to IBD but highly influenced by the host’s environmental exposures (for example, dietary exposures). Such a subset of taxa related to dysbiosis were reported in a recent comparison between treatment-naïve patients with Crohn’s disease and healthy controls [20], and the ratio of the disease-associated taxa to the health-associated taxa was referred to as the...
