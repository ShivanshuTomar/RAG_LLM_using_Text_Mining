members that are bioactive. We define metabolite bioactivity as its causal, responsive, or incidental association with a health, disease, or exposure-response phenotype—each of these associations have potential diagnostic, therapeutic, or (microbiome) functional characterization applications. This definition includes microbial compounds that have been found to transmit chemical signals locally (in the gut) or systemically (via circulation) in conditions such as diabetes, obesity, or the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (Agus et al, 2021; Franzosa et al, 2019; Lavelle and Sokol, 2020; Lloyd-Price et al, 2019). IBD in particular is one of the best-studied complex microbiome-linked conditions, in which structural, functional, and metabolic consequences of gut dysbiosis have been identified (Franzosa et al, 2019; Lloyd-Price et al, 2019; Zhang et al, 2022). Prior stool metabolite profiling from IBD patients has demonstrated that several hundred fatty acid, secondary bile acid, triterpenoid, cholesterol, and other metabolite classes tend to be depleted during disease, while far fewer are commonly enriched (De Preter et al, 2015; Franzosa et al, 2019; Garner et al, 2007; Lloyd-Price et al, 2019). Specifically, anti-inflammatory roles have been identified for a very small number of these compounds. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are among the best-known, as enhancers of anti-inflammatory CD4+ regulatory (T reg) cell populations via host receptor-dependent and independent pathways (Atarashi et al, 2013; Smith et al, 2013); they also influence a panoply of functions in epithelial, myeloid, and innate lymphoid cells (Chun et al, 2019; Kelly et al, 2015; Lavoie et al, 2020; Maslowski et al, 2009). Several bile acid derivatives also regulate IBD-relevant intestinal immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, T reg, and effector T cells (Thomas et al, 2022). However, a mechanistic understanding of bioactivity is currently lacking for most mass spectrometric features that are perturbed during IBD, mainly due to the lack of annotation (Franzosa et al, 2019; Viant et al, 2017).

This situation is unique neither to IBD nor to the gut microbiome overall, since features quantified in a variety of settings by chromatographic and mass spectrometry methods are frequently difficult to annotate (Chaleckis et al, 2019; Viant et al, 2017). For a small subset of features (typically a few hundred out of tens of thousands detected), annotation is possible through comparison with internal references (standards) or fully unique mass (mass-to-charge or m/z) matches with small molecules in databases (Franzosa et al, 2019; Lloyd-Price et al, 2019) such as the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) (Wishart et al, 2022) and METLIN (Guijas et al, 2018). Simple mass-matching is particularly ineffective for microbial community metabolomes given its ambiguity and the underrepresentation of microbial metabolites in public databases. In addition to fully de novo chemistry, microbes often modify well-characterized standard metabolites such as amino acids, primary bile acids, and carnitine, among others into compounds that have roles in human health (Agus et al, 2021; Koeth et al, 2013; Rowland et al, 2018). Such microbial derivatives are then structurally similar to their parent standards but can have variable chemical properties due to side-chain derivatization or conformational changes. “Guilt-by-association” approaches (Edmands et al, 2017; Naake and Fernie, 2019; Uppal et al, 2017; Wang et al, 2016), which rely on the similarity of one or more physical (chromatographic retention time (RT); m/z) or chemical (MS2 fragmentation spectra; molecular fingerprints) properties or co-abundance between features to identify putative conjugates or derivatives, have been successfully adapted from similar work in gene and protein function annotation (van Dam et al, 2018; Zhou et al, 2005). The Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) platform is the main repository for this type of information (Wang et al, 2016), by leveraging similarity of MS2 fragmentation spectra to cluster features (including, relatedly, the identification of novel bioactive bile acid conjugates in IBD (Quinn et al, 2020)). For metabolomics datasets lacking MS2 information, correlated abundances across samples have been useful in deciphering potential functional associations among features (Franzosa et al, 2019; Naake and Fernie, 2019; Uppal et al, 2017). Covarying features are 15× more likely to belong to the same chemical class (Franzosa et al, 2019), and covariation between identified compounds and epidemiologically relevant unknown features can aid annotation of the latter. However, phenotypes such as IBD often involve perturbation of several thousand features (Franzosa et al, 2019; Lloyd-Price et al, 2019), making it challenging to simultaneously annotate and prioritize them for rigorous experimental characterization and translational applications.

We thus developed a method to prioritize potentially bioactive metabolomic features from microbial communities, using it to explore 546 single-MS (MS1) gut metabolomes from the Integrative Human Microbiome Project (iHMP or HMP2) spanning 80 IBD patients and 26 non-IBD (control) individuals that were longitudinally profiled (Lloyd-Price et al, 2019). This assigned prioritizations based on epidemiology, ecology, and molecular properties to 37,201 metabolic features, about 99% of which were unannotated. In total, 15,482 of these were newly associated with at least one standard metabolite based on covarying abundance. From these, 2672 unannotated features associated with well-characterized metabolites spanning 33 chemical classes were both highly prioritized and consistently perturbed with respect to potential bioactivity in IBD. These included metabolites placed into classes previously implicated in IBD such as bile acids (Chen et al, 2019) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (Li et al, 2021), as well as classes with lesser-known roles in gut inflammation such as bilirubins, vitamins, and polyamines. The implementation of this method (MACARRoN or Metabolome Analysis and Combined Annotation Ranks to pRioritize Novel bioactives) is available as open-source and is generalizable to any metabolomics profile or technology. Its confirmed predictions in IBD, including nicotinamide riboside and potentially novel bilirubin compounds, expand our understanding of chronic disease states and provide novel candidates for additional mechanistic characterization and drug development efforts.

# Prioritizing potentially actionable bioactive metabolites from the stool metabolome

Our identification of novel, potentially bioactive gut microbial compounds in IBD began with 81,867 unique features identified from 546 HMP2 stool metabolomes (Lloyd-Price et al, 2019), which contained an average of 50,090 (SD = 2937) features per sample. Here, a feature is a chemical entity characterized by a unique combination of RT and m/z (accuracy of +/− 5 ppm). These metabolomes were profiled from 265 Crohn’s disease (CD), 146
