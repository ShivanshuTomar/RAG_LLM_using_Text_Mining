Peptides and mucins and a decrease of MHC-II antigen presentation by APC. Crucially, FMT induced a shift towards a tolerogenic IL-10-secreting cytokine profile that ameliorated intestinal inflammation.

In a separate study, FMT was shown to up-regulate the expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), IL-10 and TGF-β in colon tissues in mice with DSS-induced colitis and was associated with improvement in the severity of colon mucosa injury and histological parameters [102]. This correlated with gut microbial recovery of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species and an increase in tryptophan levels which, as demonstrated by this study, results in differentiation of immune cells in order to promote or regulate the release of anti-inflammatory factors [103–105].

Administration of FMT to mice following perturbation of gut microbiota with 8 weeks of broad-spectrum antibiotics led to the re-establishment of small intestinal CD4+, FoxP3+ CD8+ and B220+, as well as of colonic CD4+ and FoxP3+ cell numbers as early as 7 days post-FMT [106]. Antibiotic treatment resulted in reduced cytokine production (IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22 and IL-10) by CD4+ T cells. These effects were, however, completely restored following FMT. Seven days post-FMT, a strong IL-10 response was observed in the colon, which at 28 days reached levels similar to antibiotic untreated control mice. A follow-up study showed that introduction of gut commensals E. coli and L. johnsonii increased the frequencies of Tregs, activated dendritic cells and intestinal memory/effector T cell populations 28 days after antibiotic-induced microbiota depletion [107]. This effect was inferior to that seen with FMT, and only L. johnsonii was able to maintain colonic IL-10 production. In another antibiotic-induced dysbiosis model of BALB/c mice, intragastric FMT resulted in earlier reductions of α-defensins 5 and 6 together with an increase in β-defensin 2 and concentration of secretory IgA in comparison to those that recovered spontaneously [108].

Administration of FMT following ileocolic resection in an IL-10−/− murine model prevented ileal inflammation but worsened colitis, and was associated with increases in colonic mucosal TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-2 levels compared to non-operative controls. These paradoxical findings are interesting, and support the IL-10-dependent regulatory immune-mediated mechanisms of FMT that appear to be abrogated in an IL-10 knock-out model of IBD [109]. A study with anti-retroviral-treated, chronically simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques that received antibiotics showed significant increases in the number of peripheral Th17 and Th22 cells following administration of FMT. Reduced CD4+ T cell activation [based on expression of human leucocyte antigen D-related (HLA-DR)] in gastrointestinal tissues was also observed, and this correlated negatively with an abundance of butyrate producer Roseburia [110].

# Mechanisms of FMT-induced immune regulation of colonic inflammation

The evidence presented so far outlines key themes explored to date around the immunoregulatory mechanisms of FMT in IBD, as summarized in Fig. 1. Administration of FMT is associated with an increase in the production of specific anti-microbial peptides, secretory IgA and mucin, thereby minimizing pathogen invasion by antigen/pathogen-dependent and -independent targeting. There is some evidence to suggest a reduction of neutrophils, macrophages, proinflammatory cytokines and down-regulation of MHC-II-dependent presentation of bacterial antigens in response to FMT administration. Collectively, however, the strongest evidence, primarily from animal models and clinical studies, indicate its significance in the induction of colonic mucosal Tregs with an IL-10-dependent resolution of inflammation in IBD. This amelioration of colonic inflammation was associated with enrichment of specific Clostridium clusters that include the SCFA-producing families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae and genus Roseburia.

An increasingly recognized feature of gut commensals is their ability to induce Tregs via various molecular mechanisms (Fig. 2). Tregs play a critical role towards maintaining peripheral tolerance in vivo by actively suppressing pro-inflammatory T cell cytokine secretion and proliferation. Thus, these cells are critical towards maintaining immune balance and restricting aberrant inflammation. It is likely that introduction or enrichment of specific strains of bacteria through FMT promotes Treg proliferation in the colonic mucosa and lymph nodes, thereby attenuating inflammation [111]. Tregs can be induced through products of bacterial metabolism, including SCFA, tryptophan metabolites and PSA.

SCFA such as acetate (C2), propionate (C3) and butyrate (C4) and organic acids (lactate) are derived from the fermentation of host-indigestible polysaccharide and oligosaccharide, together with certain amino acids [112]. The metabolism of these saccharides involves enzymatic pathways that are facilitated by several bacterial species. The transcription factor FoxP3 is centrally involved in the establishment and maintenance of the Treg cell phenotype, and its activity is regulated post-translationally by histone/protein acetyltransferases and histone/protein deacetylases (HDACs) [113]. SCFAs produced by these bacteria are involved in stimulating colonic Tregs through direct physical inhibition of HDACs or inhibition of HDACs through specific G-protein-coupled receptors signalling, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPR)41, GPR43 and GPR109a [114]. Furthermore, SCFA promotes differentiation of naive.
