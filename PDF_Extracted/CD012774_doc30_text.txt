considered composite outcomes, if available, and results continued to favor FMT versus control for induction of remission in people with active UC (Analysis 1.10). Therefore, we consider that the observed effect of FMT on induction of remission in people with active UC seems to hold regardless of how remission is defined.

We conducted ITT analyses with the assumption that all participants who were randomized to a group would be analyzed in the same group irrespective of whether they received the intervention or completed follow-up. Participants lost to follow-up were considered to have experienced treatment failure in both the intervention and control groups. Some experts advocate for analysis of only those participants who completed follow-up to avoid attrition bias. Thus, we performed a post-hoc sensitivity analysis using available cases, which had similar results for the use of FMT for induction of clinical remission in people with active UC (Analysis 1.9).

# Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

Since the publication of the original version of this review (Imdad 2018), multiple meta-analyses have been published on the safety and efficacy of FMT for treatment of either UC or CD (Caldeira 2020; Fehily 2021; Zhao 2020). The systematic reviews on use of FMT for induction of remission in people with UC mirrored the results noted in our review (Caldeira 2020; Zhao 2020). However, these reviews also included single-arm cohort studies that we did not include here. The systematic review on use of FMT for treatment of CD also included both RCTs and cohort studies (Fehily 2021). That review included two RCTs that we screened (Sokol 2020; Yang 2020), of which we only included Sokol 2020 and excluded Yang 2020 because it compared use of FMT via gastroscopy versus colonoscopy but both groups received FMT, which did not qualify as an eligible comparison under our inclusion criteria. Overall, the results were similar in these RCTs, and no conclusive statements could be made about FMT for treatment of CD.

# AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS

# Implications for practice

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may increase the proportion of people with mild-to-moderate active ulcerative colitis (UC) who achieve clinical and endoscopic remission with little to no difference in any adverse events. The evidence was very uncertain about the risk of serious adverse events or improvement in quality of life when FMT was used for induction of remission in active UC. The evidence was also very uncertain about the use of FMT for maintenance of remission in both UC and Crohn disease (CD), and no conclusive statements could be made in this regard. We found no randomized trials on use of FMT for induction of remission in CD.

# Implications for research

Additional studies are needed to further assess the use of FMT for treatment of UC and CD, especially in people with severe disease, as most studies in this review assessed the use of FMT for induction of remission in adults with mild-to-moderate UC. Only one small study assessed the use of FMT to treat UC in children, so more studies are needed in the pediatric population as well. Further evaluations of the microbiome and metabolome are also needed to establish the exact mechanism of action of FMT in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is important to note that the composition of human microbiota is highly heterogeneous with high interindividual variability. Thus, more in-depth analyses exploring the functional impact of FMT on the microbiota of people with IBD are needed. Furthermore, the included studies did not explore other components of the microbiome such as the virome or fungome, which have been recently appreciated as important factors in health and disease (Carding 2017; Witherden 2017). Also, it is unclear whether non-microbial components of stool, such as bile acids, have any impact on treatment outcomes. Finally, socioeconomic status and other barriers to participation in clinical trials could potentially bias the population that is enrolled and studied. Future clinical trials on the use of FMT for treatment of IBD should try to recruit a diverse and representative population. However, we acknowledge that it is very challenging to recruit people into studies in which the intervention needs an extensive regulatory process, such as FMT. Multiple factors make enrollment of a diverse sample challenging in the USA, such as distrust among African-American communities towards academic research (Nooruddin 2020), language barriers among immigrant communities (Nageswaran 2022), and poor access to health care among Native-American and rural communities (Ghebre 2014). We hope that the data synthesized in this Cochrane Review will help future research in creating an 'evidence-based' study design to take full advantage of the efforts to recruit participants into FMT trials.

The strongest evidence for use of FMT comes from its use in the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI), in which a single dose from a single donor might be effective in about 60% to 80% of patients, and the proportion increases to over 90% with follow-up treatment in those who did not respond to the first treatment (Cammarota 2015; Cammarota 2017; Kelly 2021). The characteristics of FMT administration for treatment of IBD might be different from those for treatment of rCDI. For example, the two largest studies in this review, which showed promising results, used stool from multiple donors and their frequency of administration ranged from three times in an eight-week period (Costello 2019) to 40 times in an eight-week period (Paramsothy 2017). Further data are needed to delineate aspects of FMT use for treatment of IBD in terms of route (upper versus lower gastrointestinal tract), frequency, type of donor (single versus pooled), timing (primary induction versus rescue therapy), preparation of stool (aerobic versus anaerobic; frozen versus fresh), and duration of therapy (for induction of remission). Another important aspect to assess in use of FMT is whether it can be used as an adjuvant therapy to increase the rates of induction of remission and to avoid treatment failures such as development of antibodies to biologics.

The use of FMT for maintenance of remission in UC and CD might pose unique challenges related to long-term safety of this intervention. Data from observational studies indicate that a single dose of FMT may change the microbiome and have long-term effects including the risk of developing chronic diseases (Alang 2015; Saha 2021). Similarly, each dose of FMT may increase the risk of transmission of infection, and this risk might increase significantly in the setting of multiple doses given over longer periods of time. Thus, future studies that aim to evaluate the use of FMT for maintenance of remission in UC or CD should plan for long-term follow-up of these patients to assess for any adverse effects with long-term consequences.
