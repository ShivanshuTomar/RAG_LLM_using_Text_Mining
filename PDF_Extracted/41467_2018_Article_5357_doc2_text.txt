a Experimental workflow; b Distribution of quantified human- and microbiome-derived protein groups. Venn diagram indicates the numbers of quantified protein groups, while the bar graph shows the intensity of human or microbiome proteins. c Human-to-microbiome ratios of total protein intensity. For the box plot, the bottom and top of the box are the first and third quartiles, respectively. The middle line represents the sample median. Whiskers are drawn from the ends of the interquartile range (IQR) to the furthest observations within 1.5 times the IQR range. Outliers >1.5 times the IQR are indicated with circle. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. d Representative scatter plot between the percentage of human proteins and CD disease severity score.

We used metaproteomics to characterize the functionality of intestinal microbiome from 176 MLI aspirate samples collected from the descending colon (DeC), ascending colon (AsC), or terminal ileum (TI), either with or without inflammation, at the time of diagnostic colonoscopy (Table 1 and Fig. 1a). We quantified 229,996 unique peptides and 53,207 protein groups in these 176 samples, with an average identification rate of 39 ± 8% (mean ± SD). On average, 32,882 ± 8836 unique peptides and 14,603 ± 3328 protein groups were identified per sample. There were 226 that showed biogeographic site-specific expressions (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 2). To ensure consistent MS performance, a quality control (QC) sample was generated by combining 10 randomly selected MLI samples; this sample was then repeatedly run in every MS batch analysis. Sample-wise Pearson correlations of the quantified proteins showed that there was no obvious sample clustering based on MS date, and the eight QC samples closely clustered together (with Pearson’s r of 0.86 ± 0.02; Supplementary Fig. 2). These results indicate reproducible MS measurements and metaproteomic workflow in this study.

# Intestinal MLI metaproteome landscape alterations in IBD.

One advantage of metaproteomics is that both microbiota and host proteins can be measured in a single analysis. Among the 53,207 protein groups quantified, 93% were from intestinal microorganisms, with only 3488 (7%) protein groups derived from the host. However, human proteins constituted 52% of the total protein intensities measured in the MLI samples (Fig. 1b), indicating that the MLI microbiome was associated with abundant host proteins. Our sample preparation workflow is also similar to procedures for isolating shed microvesicles (100–1000 nm), which often employ a 10,000–20,000 g centrifugation step, and this could partially explain the high levels of human proteins in our samples. In evaluating the ratios between human and microbial proteins in MLI aspirate samples, we found that the samples from both CD and UC patients had an elevated proportion of human proteins (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, the percentage of human proteins significantly correlated with the clinical disease severity in CD (p = 0.006, 0.026, and 0.125 for DeC, AsC, and TI, respectively; Fig. 1d) but not in UC (p = 0.152, 0.167, and 0.052 for DeC, AsC, and TI, respectively).

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the MLI human-derived proteins or non-human proteins (i.e. microbiota-derived) quantified in ≥50% of the samples. The PCA score plot using the MLI human proteins showed an obvious separation between control and IBD along the first component (PC1), while no obvious difference was observed between CD and UC (Fig. 2a). In addition, the IBD samples emanating from intestinal areas without macroscopic inflammation tend to locate between those of controls and inflamed areas (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3). By contrast, the PCA analysis of microbiota-derived proteins showed that the control subjects were clustered together with most of the IBD subjects, and only a subset of IBD samples were shifted from the control. No obvious segregation corresponding to intestinal locations, or the presence of inflammation, was observed (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3). Within-group metaproteome variations were evaluated.
