# Mice

C57BL/6J (B6) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and were housed in the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. All mice were housed in microisolator cages in the barrier facility with a constant 12-h light cycle. Female mice were used at 6–8 weeks of age and fed standard chow (PicoLab Mouse Diet 5058). Mice were randomized to experimental groups one week prior to the start of an experimental intervention to minimize cage-based or housing bias. All animal studies and experiments described in this manuscript were approved and carried out in accordance with the Harvard Medical School’s Standing Committee on Animals and the National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal use and care.

Germ-free (GF) WT C57BL/6J mice were bred and maintained in isocages under a strict 12-h light cycle in the Harvard T. H. Chan Gnotobiotic Center for Mechanistic Microbiome studies. WT C57BL/6J (SPF) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine) and were maintained under the same conditions as GF mice for 3 weeks. Mice used for the experiment were between 8 and 9 weeks of age and fed sterilizable soy protein-free extruded rodent diet (Envigo CAT #: 2020SX).

# Metabolomics

Fecal contents (30–100 mg) were collected from both GF and SPF mice and snap-frozen. Stool samples were processed and untargeted metabolomics data were collected using the HILIC-positive LC–MS method as previously described (Lloyd-Price et al, 2019).

# Acute DSS-induced colonic injury and inflammation model

C57BL/6J WT were treated with 3% (w/v) DSS ad libitum in the drinking water for 5 days and followed by regular drinking water for 2 days. Body weight was measured every day and mice were sacrificed on day 7. On sacrifice, colon length was measured and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for histology. NR (1000 mg/kg) or PBS intraperitoneal injections started 2 days before DSS was added to the drinking water and continued until the day of sacrifice at the same time daily.

# Chronic DSS-induced colonic injury and inflammation model

C57BL/6J WT were treated with three cycles of DSS as follows: cycle 1 (3% (w/v) DSS ad libitum in the drinking water for 5 days and followed by regular drinking water for 9 days), cycle 2 (2% (w/v) DSS ad libitum in drinking water for 5 days and followed by regular drinking water for 9 days), and cycle 3 (1% (w/v) DSS ad libitum in drinking water for 5 days and followed by regular drinking water for 2 days). On sacrifice, colon length was measured, and colons were opened longitudinally prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). NR (1000 mg/kg) (Brown et al, 2014; Igarashi et al, 2019) or PBS intraperitoneal injections started 2 days before initiation of the first cycle of DSS and continued until the day of sacrifice at the same time daily. Body weight was measured every day until the mice were sacrificed.

# Histology

Colons were cleaned with PBS prior to fixation in 4% PFA and then processed by routine paraffin embedding, sectioning, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for the acute colitis model or both H&E and Masson’s trichrome staining for the chronic DSS model. Colitis scores were determined by a pathologist (JNG), who was blinded to the experimental parameters. Each of the four histologic parameters was scored as absent (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3): mononuclear cell infiltration, polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, epithelial hyperplasia, and epithelial injury. The scores for the parameters were summed to generate the histologic colitis score and were further quantified to include the percentage involvement by the disease process: (1) <10%; (2) 10–25%; (3) 30–50%; (4) >50% and presented as histologic colitis scores as follows: cumulative score * % involvement (Chun et al, 2019).
