and has been terminated due to the sponsor's decision (CSL Behring). Moreover, a study on IL-10−/− mice demonstrated that complete blockade of IL-6 significantly worsens gut inflammation. The exact mechanism of this outcome is not yet fully understood; nevertheless, intestinal inflammation may develop following Treg/CD152 inhibition and induction of the IL-1β/Th2 pathway. It has also been shown that more severe inflammatory conditions are seen in the intestines of double-mutant mice (IL-10−/− , IL-6 −/− ), indicating the importance of IL-6 in the homeostasis of mucosal immune responses. As a result, blockade of the IL-6/IL-6R axis components in IBD patients should be associated with greater caution as it may worsen the patient's condition (Ye et al. 2020).

Regarding the role of ILCs in IBD pathogenesis, these cells might be potential therapeutic targets for IBD treatment (Goldberg et al. 2015). For instance, depletion of ILCs as well as targeting IL-6, IL-23, and JAK signaling can lead to inhibition of ILCs and Th17 (Buonocore et al. 2010). Consequently, inhibiting Th17 and ILCs as IL-6 producers in the inflamed intestinal tissue can suppress the IL-6/IL-6R/STAT3 signals, reducing inflammatory responses and enhancing apoptosis of effector T cells. Filgotinib is a JAK inhibitor that impairs downstream signals of IL-6, IL-10, and interferon (IFN) family cytokines via hindering JAK1. Findings of a clinical trial study (NCT02048618) demonstrated that using this inhibitor in patients with CD had a promising clinical outcome. This study reported that following 20 weeks of treatment of CD patients with filgotinib (200 mg once a day), patients achieved significantly clinical remission, defined as Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) of less than 150. Advantageous effects of filgotinib therapy were also realized on D'Haens histopathology scores, simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) responses, and inflammatory biomarkers activity (Vermeire et al. 2017).

Evidence shows that tryptanthrin (TRYP) with anti-inflammatory properties has been successful in DSS-induced colitis by improving the histopathological structure of the inflamed colon tissue and reducing IL-6, STAT3, and TNF-α. Additionally, the phosphorylation of STAT3 was repressed by TRYP. These findings demonstrated that TRYP could regulate the IL-6/STAT3 and TNF-α/NFKB p56 signaling pathways by hindering STAT3 phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (Wang et al. 2018).

It has been shown that Sphaerophysa salsula, honey bee propolis, and Pterocarpus marsupium contain 3′-Hydroxypterostilbene (trans-3,5-dimethoxy-3′,4′-hydroxystilbene), which
