from 3.125 to 100 μg/mL) were noncytotoxic to human intestinal epithelial HT-29 and murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell lines after 48 h (Fig. 2A and B), suggesting that YBNs@PDA is a suitable and safe drug candidate to reach the local inflamed colonic regions. Flow cytometry analysis for detecting nanoparticles internalization efficacy in cells are shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3. YBNs@PDA were rapidly internalized into cells within only 1 h in both the RAW264.7 and HT-29 cells. Using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF) labeling, we were able to quantify the increased amount of intracellular ROS generation in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 2D and E) and HT-29 (Additional file 1: Fig. S4) under LPS-induced or H2O2 stress conditions. YBNs@PDA, but not YBNs alone, induced generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines was substantially attenuated the intracellular ROS over-generation. Nonetheless, it is intriguing that YBNs did not exhibit ROS-responsiveness and were incapable of preserving HT-29 cells, revealing PDA possesses prominent cytoprotective effect. Subsequently, the anti-inflammation effects of YBNs@PDA were examined by measuring the typical pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Figure 2F shows that the LPS-induced generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines was greatly reduced by YBNs@PDA, whereas no noticeable impact was seen in the YBNs-treated group, which was.
