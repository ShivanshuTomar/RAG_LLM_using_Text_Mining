# Interventions

# Experimental arm

- FMT 3 times after inclusion and randomization

# Control arm

- Sham transplantation 3 times after inclusion and randomization

# Outcomes

# Primary outcome

- Steroid-free clinical and endoscopic remission (defined as Total Mayo score ≤ 2 and no subscore > 1; mucosal healing defined as endoscopic subscore 0 or 1 via sigmoidoscopy) at week 12 after FMT or sham

# Secondary outcomes

- Steroid-free clinical remission (Partial Mayo Clinic score 0 or 1) at weeks 12 and 24 after FMT or sham
- Steroid-free endoscopic response (Mayo Endoscopy subscore ≤ 1, with reduction of ≥ 1 point from baseline) at week 12 after FMT or sham
- Steroid-free endoscopic remission (Endoscopic Mayo Clinic score of 0) at week 12 after FMT or sham
- Microbiota composition and diversity (assessed by 16s sequencing compared to baseline and donor microbiota) at weeks 12 and 24 after FMT or sham
- Proportion of adverse events (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, modified intestinal transit, episode of infection) in each group through study completion, up to 25 months and 1 week
- Inflammatory biologic parameters (CRP, fecal calprotectin, platelet count) up to week 24
- Endoscopic lesions at colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy by Endoscopic Mayo score at week 12 after FMT or sham
