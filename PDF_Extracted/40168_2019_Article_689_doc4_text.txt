shown that genes encoding enzymes for the same metabolic pathway are often clustered on chromosome and such a clustering is conserved in genomes of related organisms [30]. Thus, the genes baiN and CLOSCI_00522 can possibly belong to the same metabolic pathway, namely bai pathway. The enzyme for the last step of the bai pathway, NADH-dependent 3α-hydroxysteroid reductase, is unknown. Because the product of CLOSCI_00522 is a NADH-dependent reductase, we propose that product is an enzyme catalyzing the final reaction of the bai pathway (Fig. 2) and rename the gene to baiO. The bai pathway has also been found in Eggerthella lenta [23]; consequently, we searched for orthologs of the baiNO genes in the E. lenta genome. Because C. scindens and E. lenta belong to different phyla, we defined orthologs of the analyzed genes as best/symmetrical bidirectional hits (see the “Materials and methods” section). An ortholog of the BaiN in E. lenta is likely to be encoded by the gene Elen_1017 (protein identity = 32%, e-value for the protein alignment = 3e−44), whereas the BaiO ortholog was encoded by the gene Elen_1018 (identity = 45%, e-value = e−126). These genes were co-localized in E. lenta’s genome as well in genomes of Eggerthella sp. 1_3_56FAA and Eggerthella sp. HGA1 (Additional file 2: Figure S3). Additionally, these genes were co-localized with a gene encoding for a probable transporter (Elen_1016) in the genomes of E. lenta and Eggerthella sp. HGA1. Hence, the gene Elen_1016 was assumed to encode a transporter for the products of the bai pathway and was named here baiP. An ortholog of this gene (CLOSCI_01264, identity = 59%, e-value = e−180) was found in C. scindens genome as well in other genomes of Clostridiaceae, having the bai pathway (Additional file 2: Figure S3), whereas in the C. hiranonis genome, this gene was co-localized with the baiO gene. Phylogenetic analysis of the BaiNOP proteins and their homologs revealed that BaiN and BaiO proteins of Eggerthella spp. and Clostridiales are phylogenetically distant from each other (Additional file 2: Figure S4 and S5), whereas BaiP proteins from these groups of genomes are phylogenetically close (Additional file 2: Figure S6).

In summary, our comparative genomics results expanded substantially our knowledge about bile acid deconjugation and transformation in gut microbes, while being consistent with previous studies [21–25]. Consequently, we propose that 253 of the 693 analyzed intestinal microbes (37%) can deconjugate and/or transform bile acids, including 232 reconstructed AGORA organisms (Additional file 1: Table S1, Fig. 1a).

# Expansion of the gut microbial genome-scale reconstructions by a species-specific bile acid subsystem.

The manual curation and refinement of genome-scale reconstructions is an iterative process [8]. Species-specific pathways are typically absent in draft reconstructions [31]. Since we did not explicitly account for bile acid pathways in the curation of AGORA [15] prior to the present paper, this subsystem was absent. The 232 metabolic reconstructions found to carry bile acid enzymes (Additional file 1: Table S1) were expanded with the corresponding metabolites and reactions, while ensuring functionality of the included pathways, following established procedures [8, 32] (see “Materials and methods” section). The complete reconstructed bile acid biotransformation subsystem contained 39 bile acid metabolites and 82 reactions (Fig. 2, Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S2a, b). For CA, CDCA, and the 13 secondary bile acids (Table 1), transport and exchange reactions enabling the uptake and secretion of these metabolites were added to the corresponding reconstructions. Taken together, we expanded the AGORA reconstructions with a bile acid module thus further improving their predictive potential and enabling their use for large-scale simulations of bile acid deconjugation and transformation.

# Investigating the complementary capabilities of human gut microbes in silico

The majority of primary bile acids, released by the human gallbladder into the intestine, where the gut microbiome encounters them, are conjugated to glycine or taurine [3]. However, many strains capable of synthesizing secondary bile acids do not possess the bile salt hydrolase (Additional file 1: Table S1) and thus, rely on bile salt hydrolase-encoding strains to access the deconjugated primary bile acids.

To determine the capability of each strain alone to convert the deconjugated primary bile acids into secondary bile acids, the 232 corresponding AGORA reconstructions were converted into condition-specific models by applying an Average European diet supplemented with taurocholate (Tauro-CA), glycocholate (Glyco-CA), taurochenodeoxycholate (Tauro-CDCA), and glycochenodeoxycholate (Glyco-CDCA) (Additional file 1: Table S3) as modeling constraints. The maximally possible production flux for the 13 secondary bile acids was predicted for each strain using flux balance analysis [9] while setting the corresponding exchange reactions as the objective function (see the “Materials and methods” section). A total of nine strains could synthesize 7-ketodeoxycholate (7-keto-DCA) and 7-dehydrochenodeoxycholate (7-dehydro-CDCA) from the conjugated primary bile acids as they possessed both the bile salt hydrolase and the 7α-HSDH (Table 1). In contrast, no single strain was capable of synthesizing 12-dehydrocholate (12-dehydro-CA), ursocholate (UCA), and UDCA from the conjugated primary bile acids. Of the five strains carrying the bai gene cluster, only Clostridium hiranonis TO-931 could synthesize LCA and DCA from the conjugated primary bile acids (Table 1) as it also possessed the bile salt hydrolase enzyme in.
