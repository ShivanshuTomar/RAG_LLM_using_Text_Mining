arise from totally different origins and may be closely connected to potential individual confounding factors, including (mental) health status and inter-individual variability in stress responsiveness and/or vulnerability. Therefore, future research involving preclinical studies as well as large-scale, controlled clinical trials should not only focus on unravelling the exact mechanisms through which stress affects IBD. However, it is also of great interest to further investigate the exact mechanisms of how stress management can orchestrate beneficial effects in IBD and how stress-relieving therapies should be implemented in IBD care.
