Antiretroviral therapy does not impact on growth changes in IL-10 − / − mice. A SvEv WT and IL-10 − / − mice commenced intervention aged 4 weeks with control (placebo) or cART for 12 weeks ± 1 week with daily nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (1 mg emtricitabine and 1.5 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and protease inhibitors (4 mg lopinavir boosted with 1 mg ritonavir) in drinking water. Body weight was continuously measured. Interventions occurred at 12 weeks at which times histology tissue scores, mucosal cytokine production, and viral assessments were performed. B Mouse weight, expressed as a percentage change compared to week 0, was measured every 2 weeks over a total of 12 weeks (mean ± SEM, ****p < 0.0001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05)

treated with cART compared to placebo (Fig. 6A). In contrast, there were no significant changes in abundance of microbial taxa in SvEv WT mice treated with ART compared to placebo (Fig. 6B).

# Discussion

The etiology of IBD is complex, involving genetics, a dysregulated immune system, environmental factors, and the interaction of the virome within the microbiome [1, 3, 4, 31]. Herein, we characterized a Betaretrovirus infection in the IL-10−/− model of colitis, which is endemic in laboratory mice, replicates in the mucosal lymphocytes using a viral superantigen mechanism, and subverts immune responses by triggering the production of IL-10 [14, 17]. We report an increased viral load of MMTV in breast milk and colon of the IL-10−/− mouse, pro-inflammatory cellular responses to MMTV, and viral superantigen activity in
