There is lack of data available regarding KYNU differential expression in ReA, therefore the experimental evaluation of KYNU through targeted expression analysis in ReA patients was carried out. A non-probabilistic convenience sampling was followed for our single blind study.

This study encompassed 15 individuals: 60% male with mean age of 45.7 and 40% female with mean age of 38 (9 males and 6 females). Out of these cases were: 10 with ReA and controls were: 3 currently undergoing treatment, 1 with Poncet’s Disease (PD) and 1 Healthy control (HC). The clinical characteristics of the patients recruited in the study included inflammatory back pain in 33%, fatigue in 60%, fever in 27%, swollen joint in 47%, Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) that affects spine in 7%, dactylitis that is inflammation in finger or toe in 7% and Poncet’s Disease (PD) in 7% of participants. The clinical characteristics of the recruits are provided in Table 3.

The expression of KYNU in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC’S) of ReA cases vs controls was evaluated using Relative Expression Software Tool (REST) software that estimated a sample’s relative expression ratio in relation to the control housekeeping gene (here GAPDH) by calculating an intermediate absolute concentration value:

Concentration = efficiencyaverage CP (controls)−average CP (samples)

where CP = point at which fluorescence escalates considerably above the background fluorescence.

Here the CP values for reference and target genes are collectively redistributed to control and sample groups and the expression ratios are calculated based on the mean value.

Relative expression = Concentration of gene of interest/Concentration of reference gene

a reference gene and for calculating the statistical difference of variation between 2 groups. It utilises a bootstrapping technique providing a 95% confidence interval for expression ratios. It uses a P(H1) test for testing the significance between the samples and controls.

According to our analysis, KYNU sample group is different to control group where P(H1) = 0.025. KYNU was found to be downregulated in sample group (in comparison to control group) by a mean factor of 0.115 (Standard error range is 0.018–0.837) as depicted in the whisker-box plot (Fig. 8). KYNU expression showed a ~ ninefold decline in ReA cases as compared to controls.
