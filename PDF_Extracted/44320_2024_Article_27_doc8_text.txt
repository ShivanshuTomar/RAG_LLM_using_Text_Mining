# Figure 4. MACARRoN prioritizes known and novel bioactives in IBD.

# (A)

Standards for compounds known to be IBD-linked such as IBD biomarkers and metabolites with confirmed roles in inflammation, such as acylcarnitines (AC), bile acids, hippurate (Hip.), biotin (Bio.), bilirubin (Bil.), and the short-chain fatty acid butyrate (SF), were highly prioritized (priority score >0.75) by MACARRoN. In each module containing such a known bioactive standard (total modules = 9), unannotated features were also highly prioritized ranging from 3 in module 28 anchored by deoxycholate and 49 in module 75 anchored by carnitine. The size of each module along with the number of prioritized standards (Pri-Std) and unknowns (Pri-Unk) and non-prioritized metabolic features (non-Pri-Std and non-Pri-Unk) in it are shown. Pri-Unk features typically differed from their respective co-clustered Pri-Stds by small Δm/z values (median = 27.98), indicating potential biochemical relatedness.

# (B)

Modules anchored by diverse chemical standards not typically associated with IBD were also highly prioritized in both CD-dysbiosis and UC, including vitamins, polyamines, and microbial metabolites such as stercobilin, hydrocinnamate, and p-hydroxyphenylacetate (only the higher rank among disease subtypes shown). Again, in several modules containing these standards, unannotated metabolic features differing by Δm/zs corresponding to common adducts were highly prioritized in both disease subtypes.

# (C)

Stercobilin is produced via the gut microbial reduction of bilirubin in multiple steps involving intermediates such as mesobilirubin, urobilinogen, and stercobilinogen.

# (D)

Fifteen unannotated metabolites that covaried with stercobilin and differed from it by small masses were highly prioritized by MACARRoN. Seven of these were “overlapping” i.e., had masses similar to unidentified compounds linked to (with cosine score >0.7) stercobilin or urobilin in GNPS molecular networks of 7 other stool metabolomics datasets (Dataset EV9). Pink dashed edges represent potential structural similarity (cosine score >0.7) with stercobilin (Dataset EV9).

# (E)

These highly prioritized stercobilin-linked were significantly depleted in CD-dysbiosis and UC ((Wilcoxon test, P value < 0.05*; P value < 0.01**; P value < 0.001***; NS not significant)(four representatives shown, see others in Dataset EV9).

# (F)

Two of the highly prioritized features and stercobilin were seen to be enriched in SPF (N = 6; biological replicates) mice stool metabolomes compared to GF (N = 6; biological replicates) indicating at their microbial origin (abundances in Dataset EV10; Wilcoxon test, P value < 0.05*; P value < 0.01**; P value < 0.001***; NS not significant). For the boxplots in (E, F), the bounds of the box represent the first (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) of the data, and the line inside the box is the median. The whiskers extend to a maximum of 1.5(IQR) from the Q1 and Q3. Values beyond the whiskers are outliers. The minima and maxima are determined by the minimum and maximum observed values within 1.5 (IQR) from Q1 and Q3, respectively.

which is associated with higher microbial diversity, was significantly depleted in both subtypes (Menni et al, 2020). Similarly, stercobilin, the end product of microbial bilirubin metabolism, was depleted (Fahmy et al, 1972; Vitek et al, 2006). Many species of clostridia and Coriobacteriaceae can convert tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylacetate and ultimately p-cresol (Elsden et al, 1976; Saito et al, 2018), which can be further hydroxylated to 4-methylcatechol, although primarily by species not typically associated with the gut such as R. opacus and P. putida (Hopper and Taylor, 1975; Kolomytseva et al, 2007). While p-hydroxyphenylacetate was enriched in both disease subtypes, 4-methylcatechol was depleted. The prioritization of p-hydroxyphenylacetate in particular is in agreement with the increased transcription of two clostridia—C. hathewayi and C. bolteae - in HMP2 metatranscriptomes (Lloyd-Price et al, 2019), as well as the previously reported expansion of Coriobacteriaceae in IBD (Alam et al, 2020).

The bilirubin family (bilirubin is represented by feature HILp_QI19549; m/z = 585.2722 [M + H]+) is among the most abundant in the gut. Bilirubin was highly prioritized only in CD-dysbiosis and is well-known for being metabolized in several steps to stercobilin and urobilin by the intestinal microbiota (Vitek et al, 2006). As in the case of microbial conversion of primary to secondary bile acids, the depletion of stercobilin concurrent with the enrichment of bilirubin likely indicates the loss of microbial enzymes which catalyze the reduction. Despite the centrality of microbial metabolism to bilirubin homeostasis (Hamoud et al, 2018), only a handful of clostridia, Bacteroides fragilis, and Citrobacter youngae have been experimentally shown to reduce bilirubin, and knowledge of microbe-made bilirubin derivatives is mostly limited to its approximately a dozen reduction products (Shiels et al, 2019; Vitek et al, 2006) (Fig. 4C). Bilirubin itself ameliorates colonic injury and inflammation in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced murine model of inflammatory colitis via its antioxidant i.e., reactive oxygen species scavenging properties (Zheng et al, 2019; Zucker et al, 2015). While bilirubin can directly prevent leukocyte migration into the colon (Vogel and Zucker, 2016), its implication in disease and reliance on gut microbes for subsequent metabolism and eliminations suggests that its derivatives may have additional functions (e.g., bile acids (Funabashi et al, 2020; Quinn et al, 2020)). Thus, we were particularly interested in the highly prioritized (in both CD-dysbiosis and UC) unannotated features in which were anchored by stercobilin in modules 10 and 85; again, these generally differed by small positive mass-differences typically suggestive of novel backbone derivatizations (Fig. 4B).

The 15 highly prioritized unannotated features in the modules 10 and 85 with small positive Δm/zs compared to stercobilin were also depleted (Fig. 4D,E; Dataset EV9). Upon closer examination of the differences in neutral masses of these features and stercobilin, we found five similar to the masses of oxygen (~15.996) and di-oxygen (~31.99) moieties (Dataset EV9). The other mass-differences that cannot be easily associated with small molecular groups may be the combined result of two or more reactions. To provide further data establishing the chemical similarity of these features to stercobilin, we examined the masses of compounds that were directly connected to stercobilin (cosine score ≥0.7 and |Δm/z | w.r.t stercobilin ≤100) in the GNPS molecular networks (MNs) of 11 MassIVE human stool metabolomics datasets (Dataset EV9). Since urobilin and stercobilin are structurally very similar, we also examined the masses of compounds directly connected to urobilin when it was included in the same molecular network as stercobilin. Although we did not find exact matches between the masses of compounds in stercobilin MNs and the highly prioritized features in our dataset, in seven instances, they differed only by ~1 (i.e., neutral mass of prioritized feature—parent mass of GNPS compound ~1) (Dataset EV9; Fig. EV2). This is within the range of typical inter-dataset differences in the observed m/zs of stercobilin itself (593.76 (MSV000079777), 594.761 (MSV000082262), 595.349 (MSV000079651), and 595.597 (MSV000082629), resulting in a Δm/z of 1.832 between the largest and smallest masses. These seven compounds in the MassIVE datasets that “overlapped” with our highly prioritized features had cosine scores ≥0.8 with stercobilin or urobilin, and four differed from them by CHO2 2 and CO2 moieties (Dataset EV9), again supporting the presence of uncharacterized disease-linked bilirubin compounds in stool.

Since stercobilin is microbially derived, we wanted to confirm if the depletion—and by extension, prioritization—of the 15 features.
