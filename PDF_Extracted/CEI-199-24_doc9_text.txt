# REVIEW SERIES: INTERACTIONS OF THE MICROBIOTA WITH THE MUCOSAL IMMUNE SYSTEM

# Immune mechanisms of FMT in UC

CD4 T cells towards a FoxP3 CD4 cell phenotype. Murine and cell culture studies have demonstrated the direct effect of SCFAs and SCFA-producing bacterial species in inducing intestinal Tregs specifically, with higher levels of FoxP3 and IL-10 expression [115,116]. Additionally, SCFAs suppress the LPS and cytokine-stimulated production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-6 and nitric oxide (NO) [117].

As described earlier, the gut microbiota–butyrate–Treg axis has been explored in seminal work conducted by Atarashi and colleagues [67,68]. They found that a consortia of 46 Clostridium species was able to significantly raise the baseline depressed levels of regulatory T cell populations in GF mice to the levels observed in conventionally raised mice. Interestingly, the Tregs induced by these Clostridium species were Helios-negative IL-10-expressing iTregs, suggesting peripheral rather than thymic induction of these immunoregulatory cells. Although they demonstrated that Treg differentiation was directly influenced by epithelial cell-derived TGF-β1 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, specific microbe-associated molecular patterns were not identified. Furthermore, oral inoculation of Clostridium of conventionally raised mice during early life resulted in resistance to colitis. Furusawa and colleagues subsequently demonstrated that colonic luminal concentrations of SCFA positively correlated with colonic Treg abundances [118].

The differentiation of Treg cells, both in vitro and in vivo, was induced by butyrate and ameliorated the development of colitis induced in an adoptive T cell transfer model of Rag1(−/−) mice. They identified enhanced histone H3 acetylation in the promoter and conserved non-coding sequence regions of the FoxP3 locus of naive T cells in the presence of butyrate, suggesting a possible mechanism for microbial-derived butyrate-induced differentiation of Tregs. These findings, together with microbiota outcomes from studies of FMT in UC, highlight the role of commensal Clostridia as being leading players in the maintenance of gut homeostasis. Phase 1 clinical studies towards exploring the efficacy of human commensal Clostridia strains for the treatment of IBD are currently in progress [119].

PSA, a glycoantigen derived from Bacteroides fragilis, has been shown to induce IL-10-producing Tregs via plasmacytoid dendritic cell stimulation in the gut [120,121]. In the absence of APCs, this pathway is also mediated by direct interaction of PSA with TLR-2 expressed by FoxP3 Treg cells to stimulate expression of immunoregulatory molecules, including IL-10, TGF-β2 and granzyme B [122]. Additionally, exposure to PSA induced differentiation of human peripheral CD4+ T cells into type-Tr1 Tregs (FoxP3−) and exhibited non-specific IL-10-mediated bystander suppression. Intriguingly, glycoantigen exposure provoked expression of gut-homing receptors on their surface to facilitate gut localization of anti-inflammatory and regulatory responses [123]. Furthermore, gut-homing of IL-10-producing regulatory T cells and differentiation of naive CD4 T cells towards a Treg phenotype is induced by interaction of vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid generated by dendritic cells in the presence of microbial antigens [124]. However, the underlying mechanisms dictated by gut microbiota in modulating intestinal retinoic acid is unclear. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) activation has been shown to drive a Treg phenotype [125]. The gut commensal B. thetaiotaomicron exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by regulating the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of PPAR-γ, thereby influencing the immune regulatory landscape in the intestine [126]. Finally, microbial tryptophan metabolites (kynurenines) produced by bacteria such as B. longum, B. thetaiotaomicron and F. prausnitzii activate the AhR pathway to reprogramme intraepithelial CD4+ T helper cells into immunoregulatory T cells and inhibit polarization towards a proinflammatory Th17 phenotype [127–129].

# Recommendations for future research exploring use of FMT in IBD

Clinical studies investigating the therapeutic use of FMT in the treatment of IBD should now adopt a focused mechanistic approach towards exploring changes in mucosal immunology. This includes understanding immune cell subset dynamics together with exploration of inter-relationships within the spatial context of the tissue microenvironment. As immune cell yield obtained from colonic biopsies limits detailed immunophenotyping via flow cytometry, techniques such as mass cytometry may be more appropriate. Furthermore, single cell sequencing of immune subsets, in particular T cells, would help to delineate tissue-specific adaptation, transcriptional dynamics and plasticity potentially towards a Treg phenotype in response to FMT. Finally, undertaking a systems biology host-microbial ‘omics’ integrative approach has the clear potential of identifying microbiota-derived mediators in driving immunoregulatory pathways.

# Conclusions

Accumulating evidence supports the causal contribution and centrality of an interaction of a disrupted gut microbiota with a primed immune response in setting up a proinflammatory environment that leads to the development and progression of IBD. Modulation of this dysbiosis by FMT shows promise in the treatment of IBD; however, strong data regarding the biological basis of this success are lacking. Insights from clinical studies and animal experiments suggest both association and a direct contribution of changes in specific members of the gut microbial community as a consequence of FMT that dictate a shift in.
