# VI. STEM CELL-DERIVED EXOSOMES AND IBD

Stem cell-derived exosomes are increasingly implicated as regulators of several stem cell-associated therapeutic effects. These exosomes are believed to elicit their therapeutic activities by delivering their cargo consisting of potentially therapeutic proteins and RNAs to recipient cells. One mechanism through which MSC-derived exosomes perform their biological function of dampening inflammation is via ubiquitination (Wu et al., 2018). Exosomes obtained from MSCs of human umbilical cord significantly attenuate IBD by upregulating levels of IL10 and IFN-γ inducible protein-10 (IP10), while downregulating IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2M), NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 (NAe1), and ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 3 (Uba3). Further analysis by western blot showed decreased expression levels of proteins such as K48, K63 and FK2 (indicating regulation of ubiquitin modification) in exosome-treated IBD mice compared with controls (Wu et al., 2018).
