# Predisposing Factor for Inflammatory Diarrhea

[Antharam et al. 2013].

Increases in certain bacteria are also observed in IBD. It remains unclear to what extent these specific increases are the driving forces of the inflammatory process (keystone pathogen) [Hajishengallis et al. 2012] versus opportunistic contributors to an already established inflammatory process (pathobiont) [Chow et al. 2011]. Some of the most consistently elevated bacterial species in IBD are members of the family Enterobacteraceae (phylum Proteobacteria). These include the iconic gut pathogens Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Escherichia coli. Indeed, there is an extensive line of research linking adherent-invasive E. coli to ileal Crohn’s disease [Darfeuille-Michaud et al. 2004]. The gut pathogen C. difficile is also increased in prevalence in IBD [Clayton et al. 2009; Berg et al. 2013]. A large multicenter study of patients with new-onset patients demonstrated increases in E. coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Veillonella parvula; this increase in combination with a decrease in other species and an overall decline in species diversity correlated strongly with inflammation [Gevers et al. 2014]. Other studies have found increases in the intracellular bacteria Mycobacterium paratuberculosis in CD [Mcnees et al. 2015] and adherent invasive bacteria, Fusobacterium, in UC [Strauss et al. 2011].

While most research has focused on bacteria, work has begun to interrogate the role of fungal and viral components of the microbiota and unlike the bacterial microbiota, the diversity of the mycobiome [Richard et al. 2015] and virome [Norman et al. 2015; Ray, 2015] appear to be increased. The pathophysiological significance of these changes is an area of active investigation. Related immune system studies are also ongoing, including evaluation of the role of C-type lectin receptor dectin 1 (CLEC7A); a polymorphism of this receptor, which appears to interact with the mycobiome, may be linked to severe UC [Iliev et al. 2012].

# Intestinal Mucosal Barrier Function in IBD

The intestinal mucosal barrier separates the microbiota, food, and other luminal contents from the innate and adaptive immune system (Figure 2). It is composed of inner and outer mucus layers impregnated with antimicrobial factors and underlying intestinal epithelial cells stitched together with connecting protein networks called tight junctions [Turner, 2009]. In a healthy gut, the microbiota does not touch epithelial cells and is sampled in a controlled manner via specialized microfold (M) cells located in Peyer’s patches along the distal small intestine [Hooper and Macpherson, 2010]. Depending on the microbe and the immune system, this can lead to either immune tolerance or activation. In IBD, this mucosal barrier is disrupted, resulting in translocation of the intestinal microbiota and potentiation of the immune system [Merga et al. 2014]. As with dysbiosis, it is debated whether changes seen in barrier function are the result or the cause of the disease.

The inner mucus layer while devoid of bacteria in healthy controls [Johansson et al. 2008], shows increased permeability in IBD allowing interaction of the microbiota with the normally inaccessible epithelial surface [Schultsz et al. 1999; Swidsinski et al. 2005; Johansson et al. 2014]. The increased permeability may be due to altered composition of the mucus components secreted by goblet cells, including decreased mucin [Moehle et al. 2006], decreased glycosylation products [Theodoratou et al. 2014], decreased trefoil factor [Aamann et al. 2014] or due to decreases in antimicrobial factors secreted into the mucus by epithelial cells (Reg3γ), Paneth cells (defensins) and plasma cells [immunoglobulin A (IgA)] [MacDermott et al. 1989; Ramasundara et al. 2009; Hooper and Macpherson, 2010]. In UC but not CD, the mucus layers are thinner or absent and the goblet cells responsible for mucus production are depleted [Johansson et al. 2014]. Certain members of the IBD-associated microbiota use mucus as an energy source and tightly regulate its production, thus there is evidence that the mucus changes may be as much the result of dysbiosis as a cause [Deplancke and Gaskins, 2001; Derrien et al. 2004; Png et al. 2010].

The network of proteins called tight junctions connecting epithelial cells also show increased permeability in IBD [Michielan and D’Inca, 2015]. Both environmental (microbes, diet) and genetic factors can influence tight junction integrity [Ulluwishewa et al. 2011]. Disruption allows microbes to translocate beyond the mucosal surface resulting in access to the immunologically active submucosa and systemic space. Endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharide) is well documented in IBD [Pastor Rojo et al. 2007] and other microbial components (flagellin, pilli, and
