# 5. Stress and Intestinal Microbiota: Bidirectional Relationship in IBD

# 5.1. Influence of Stress on Gut Microbiota

Several lines of evidence suggest that stress, induced by dietary, environmental or neuroendocrine factors, can adversely affect the gut/microbiota/brain axis [81,82] (Table 2).

# 5.1.1. Preclinical Studies

It was recently shown in mice that maternal nutrition can negatively affect offspring intestinal development and function. For instance, maternal high-fat diet caused a shift in microbiota composition, thereby predisposing the offspring to develop intestinal inflammation [83]. In line, early prenatal stress in rodents was shown to increase the Oscillibacter, Anaerotruncus, and Peptococcus genera [84] and induce a loss of Lactobacilli transmission to the neonate [84, 85], pointing towards the involvement of birth canal delivery in gut microbiota colonization [86, 87]. These data were further supported by other preclinical studies showing that short-term or mild chronic stress caused a reduction in Lactobacilli [88 – 90]. These data suggest that stressor-induced changes have important health implications [90]. It has also been shown, both in primates [91] and in rodents [92], that maternal separation, a form of chronic stress, was able to induce a change in fecal microbiota in new-born animals. A more recent study demonstrated that chronic stress resulted in dysbiosis of the murine gut microbiota, thereby inducing an immune system response and facilitating experimentally induced colitis [93]. Other genetically susceptible rodent models revealed that chronic psychological stress induced mucosal dysfunction, intestinal abnormalities, and subsequently intestinal inflammation [94]. Likewise, it was shown in rats that acute [95], environmental [96] as well as chronic stress [97] increased intestinal permeability, and hence, luminal molecule delivery to the mucosal immune system, thereby triggering pro-inflammatory responses. In this context, probiotics (living organisms yielding benefits on the host’s microbiome [98]) were shown to revert chronic stress-induced abnormalities of the intestinal tract [99]. Also, it was shown that diets containing a combination of specific long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, prebiotics, and probiotics restored the rat intestinal microbiota composition [100]. More recently, it was even demonstrated that stress hormones, through manipulation of basal corticosterone levels, were able to alter the gut microbiome of free-living birds [101]. Further, using a sophisticated rat model, water avoidance stress was shown to alter the mucus composition [102], which is known as the host’s primary innate defense. Given that changes in the production of mucosal proteins have been associated with dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, it is likely that stress indirectly affects the intestinal microbiota via inflammation of the mucosal protein layer [94].

# 5.1.2. Clinical Studies

Few clinical studies also revealed that stress is associated with digestive problems and gastrointestinal health [103]. For instance, by means of a phylogenetic microarray, one study showed that exposure to stress during pregnancy resulted in aberrant microbiota colonization patterns in pediatrics, which likely increased inflammation and gastrointestinal symptoms [104]. In line with these findings, stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression, were also associated with increased bacterial translocation, thereby activating immune responses against commensal bacteria [105]. Although these data imply that stress has a potent influence on intestinal microbiota, stress is a subjective experience, which makes it challenging to objectively evaluate the effects of stress. Therefore, further human studies should be performed to verify that stress results in dysbiosis of the gut microbiota.
