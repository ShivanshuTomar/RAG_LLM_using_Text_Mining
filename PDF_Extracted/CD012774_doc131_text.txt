libraries were pre-

pared using Nex-

tera DNA li-

brary prep [Illumina] and sequenced on a NovaSeq sequencing platform [Illumina]. Sequencing was performed with 75-bp single-end reads with the depth of 10 million reads per sample. We filtered metagenomic reads containing Illumina adapters, filtered low quality reads, and trimmed low-quality read edges. We detected host DNA by mapping with Bowtie to the human genome with inclusive parameters, and removed those reads. Bacterial relative abundance [RA] estimation was performed by mapping bacterial reads to species-level genome bins [SGB] representative genomes. We selected all SGB representatives with at least 5 genomes in a group, and for these representatives' genomes kept only unique regions as a reference dataset. Mapping was performed using Bowtie and abundance was estimated by calculating the mean cover-
