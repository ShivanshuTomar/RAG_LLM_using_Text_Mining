# Retention of YBNs@PDA in Colon

To determine whether surface coating of mucoadhesive PDA could prolong the retention duration of nano-agents in the gut. The biodistribution and absorption were monitored in mice with acute colitis after oral administration with nanoparticles labeled with fluorescent dye FITC. The real-time monitoring of FITC-conjugated YBNs@PDA was carried out using an in vivo imaging system to ascertain the temporal prediction and site specificity of the nano-agents. Although most of the FITC-YBNs and FITC-YBNs@PDA entered colon after 6 h post-administration as shown in Fig. 3A, the fluorescence intensity observed in the images of FITC-YBNs@PDA was significantly greater than that of FITC-YBNs in the colon at both 6 and 12 h post-administration (Fig. 3B). Consequently, these observations confirmed that the utilization of PDA coating has the potential to enhance the retention time of YBNs@PDA up to 12 h compared with YBNs, thereby preserving the nano-agent concentration in the colon. Based on the fluorescent images, a significant proportion of the nanodrugs were found to be concentrated within the digestive tract. Negligible fluorescence was found in other organs such as the heart, lung, liver, and kidney (Fig. 3C). This phenomenon indicated that there is minimal systemic circulation of YBNs@PDA following oral administration, and that faecal excretion may be the predominant elimination pathway for these nanoparticles.

Further study for the specific location of different nanoparticles was carried out by visualizing colon tissue penetration using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). Thus, we dissected the colon from post-administration of FITC-labeled YBNs@PDA and stained it with DAPI for nucleus reveal. As demonstrated in Fig. 3D, an evident green fluorescence signal of FITC-YBNs@PDA was stronger at the lesion site where the signal was barely observed in YBNs treated group. These findings validate the mucoadhesive capability of PDA-modified YBNs nanoparticles for intestinal absorption, allowing the nanoparticles efficiently enter into the intestinal mucosa. PDA-modified nanoparticles benefit from mucus penetration and enhanced intestinal absorption due to the zwitterionic characteristics conferred by the anionic and cationic groups in PDA polymers [26]. Taken together, our findings show that PDA-modified YBN nanoparticles have the potential to serve as effective nano-agents for the purpose of administering oral medication in the future.

# Prophylactic efficacy against acute colitis in a mouse model

Based on the above results, YBNs@PDA features several advantages such as good biocompatibility, antioxidant function, inflamed site adhesion and penetration, and anti-inflammation. Next, we sought to determine whether or not YBNs@PDA was effective as a treatment for DSS-induced colitis in a mouse model (Fig. 4A). Acute colitis was induced in 6-week-old mice by administering 2.5% DSS in drinking water for 5 days. At the same time, mice received oral gavages of YBNs@PDA or YBNs for 7 days. Colitis mice orally given PBS served as a negative control. On day 7, all mice were sacrificed to assess colon length, histological severity, IBD-associated colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, tunnel assays, ROS detection, FISH staining, and protein expressions of tight junction-associated proteins (Occludin and Claudin-1).

Our findings showed that the administration of YBNs@PDA significantly improved prophylactic and therapeutic outcomes in DSS-induced acute colitis. Mice with acute colitis treated with a high dose of YBNs@PDA promptly recovered their bodyweight and disease activity index (DAI) (Fig. 4B and Additional file 1: Fig. S5A). The YBNs@PDA group also had a much longer colon than the other treatment groups, making them equivalent in size to healthy mice (Fig. 4C and D). Furthermore, a histological analysis was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of YBNs@PDA against DSS-induced colitis. Images of H&E staining revealed that the PBS-treated group displayed several IBD symptoms, including immune cell infiltration, goblet cell depletion, and loss of colonic crypts. However, YBNs@PDA treatment could protect colon against those pathological damages (Fig. 4E). We implemented a histological scoring system based on a published literature [37]. Histopathology scores for all DSS-treated groups were considerably higher than those of the healthy control group, suggesting increased inflammatory effects. However, mice administered a high dosage of YBNs@PDA exhibited a substantial reduction in histopathological inflammation (Additional file 1: Fig. S5B), indicating that YBNs@PDA could remarkably promote the repair of colon tissues. Furthermore, goblet cells in the colon tissue treated by high-dose YBNs@PDA were more prominent than in the PBS-treated group, as shown by Alcian blue staining (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, when compared to the PBS group, those administered with YBNs exhibited a slower rate of weight loss, a longer colon, and better histopathological ratings, although this prophylactic efficacy against colitis was not as potent as YBNs@PDA group.

Neutrophil activity in the colon was evaluated by measuring MPO activity in the colon. Colon tissue from colitis control animals showed a significant increase in MPO expression (Fig. 4E), suggesting a high neutrophil.
