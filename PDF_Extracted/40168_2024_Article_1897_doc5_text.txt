Human fecal microbiota can be classified into “succinotypes” based on their dominant succinate consuming bacterium. a Relative abundances of the four identified succinate consuming genera in the fecal microbiota. b The three genera Phascolarctobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium_A, and Dialister are strongly mutually exclusive. The position in the ternary diagram shows the relative abundance of the three genera in each of the fecal microbiota. Points in the corners indicate full mutual exclusivity. c Relative abundances of the succinate consuming taxa in the fecal microbiota resolved at the species level. The asterisk indicates the dominant species in a fecal microbiota. We assign fecal microbiota with a dominant Phascolarctobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium_A to a succinotype “P” and those with a dominant Dialister to a succinotype “D”.

Clear succinotypes are found broadly and are associated with disease. a The distribution of the relative abundance ratio of Dialister (D) compared to Phascolarctobacterium/Phascolarctobacterium_A (P) in fecal samples is strongly bimodal. The histogram encompasses 9 pooled cohorts of 16S amplicon data with a total of 8911 individuals. b Transition probabilities between succinotypes over time estimated individuals with repeat samples in the BIO-ML cohort. c Distribution of relative abundances of D (red) and P (blue) in the fecal samples of healthy individuals. There is no significant difference between D and P across cohorts. d Succinate concentrations in fecal samples from the BIO-ML cohort (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.001619). e Fraction of subjects assigned the D and P succinotype across cohorts and disease status. Dark colors are healthy subjects and light colors are IBD patients. f Succinate concentrations in fecal samples from the PRISM cohort. There are no significant differences in fecal succinate between healthy subjects and IBD patients.

The majority of individuals across all cohorts had a well-defined succinotype. Most samples in the amplicon data (91.3%) had detectable abundances of either Dialister or Phascolarctobacterium, with slightly lower proportions in the shotgun data (76.9%). In order to robustly assign a succinotype, we set either a threshold of at least 10 reads assigned to either D or P (when counts were available) or otherwise a combined relative abundance of at least 0.01%. We retained 8911 samples after pruning multiple samples from the same subject. We then computed the abundance fraction, r = xD/(xD + xP), where the x are the abundances of D and P, respectively. The vast majority of samples had r values that were close to 0 or 1, respectively (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Figure S6). We thus assigned a succinotype when the abundance of D was at least ten times higher than P, and vice versa, that is r < 0.1 or r > 0.9. Doing so, we were able to assign clear succinotypes to 7,653 (85.6%) of the retained amplicon samples and 11,442 (91.2%) of the retained shotgun samples.
