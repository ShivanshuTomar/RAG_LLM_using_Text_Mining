# Interventions

# Experimental arm

- Lyophilized FMT via 10 oral capsules twice-weekly for 8 weeks + placebo enema twice-weekly for 8 weeks
- Lyophilized FMT via 10 oral capsules twice-weekly for 8 weeks + lyophilized FMT enema twice-weekly for 8 weeks

# Control arm

- Placebo via 10 oral capsules twice-weekly for 8 weeks + placebo enema twice-weekly for 8 weeks

# Outcomes

# Primary outcome

- Remission of UC following lyophilized FMT (Mayo score ≤ 2 and Mayo Endoscopic score ≤ 1) at week 9

# Secondary outcomes

- Incidence/absence of adverse events with lyophilized FMT (safety and tolerability) up to 5 years post-FMT
- UC disease progression (immediately after FMT to up to 5 years post-FMT) based on:
