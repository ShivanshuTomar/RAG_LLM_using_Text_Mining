Genetics are critical in shaping the gut microbiota [7, 8]. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), a cytosolic innate immune pattern recognition receptor and the first CD susceptibility gene identified, has been reported to play key roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis through its detection of peptidoglycan from the microbiota. A large body of evidence has revealed a role for NOD2 in shaping the composition of the gut microbiota in IBD patients as well as in animal models [7], with a recent report showing that the gut microbiota is altered in Nod2−/− mice, specifically with an expansion of Bacteroides vulgatus, a pathobiont [8]. The gene encoding caspase recruitment domain 9 (CARD9), another CD susceptibility gene whose product interacts with NOD2, was recently found to impact the gut microbiota, whereby Card9−/− mice harbor a more pro-inflammatory population of microbes with impaired tryptophan metabolism [9]. Tryptophan metabolites generated by the microbiota have been shown to be important in the mucosal immune response, and activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) by tryptophan metabolites can direct the production of IL-22, a cytokine important in intestinal homeostasis. Transfer of the microbiota from Card9−/− mice into wild-type germ-free mice resulted in increased susceptibility to colitis, delayed recovery from disease, and reduced IL-22 responses compared to wild-type controls [9]. Accordingly, supplementation with tryptophan-metabolizing Lactobacillus strains was sufficient to rescue susceptibility to colitis. These and other findings clearly show that innate immune sensors and response regulators, such as NOD2 and CARD9, respectively, limit the expansion of disease-promoting microorganisms in the gut, allowing beneficial microbes to thrive, and thus contribute to host health.

# Understanding how genetic variants are involved in microbial sensing in IBD

The close interaction between the host and the microbiota involves the shaping of the microbiota by the host and concurrent signaling from commensal microbes through immune-mediated recognition receptors to promote host tissue and immune development [2]. Maintaining this bidirectional communication is critical for supporting intestinal homeostasis. Yet, defects in host signaling pathways may result in increased susceptibility to microbial infections while at the same time may disrupt the fundamental interactions with the indigenous commensal microbes. Indeed, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified susceptibility genes involved in immune signaling pathways [1]. As described above, NOD2 is involved in bacterial sensing and pathogen surveillance during health and disease. IBD patients harboring risk variants for NOD2 are believed to be impaired in bacterial recognition and clearance, resulting in sustained intestinal inflammation—a notion supported by studies of Nod2−/− mice in response to bacterial infections [7]. Furthermore, NOD2 stimulation has been shown to activate autophagy, a conserved cellular pathway involved in the clearance of intracellular microbes [1, 7]. GWAS have also identified a link between autophagy and IBD, with autophagy pathway genes ATG16L1 (autophagy-related 16 like 1) and IRGM (immunity-related GTPase M), along with NOD2, being associated with CD susceptibility [1]. Knockout mouse models for the genes Atg16l1, Irgm, or Nod2 have all been reported to be impaired in pathogen clearance. Moreover, defects in ATG16L1 result in diminished secretion of antimicrobial peptides from abnormal Paneth cells and reduced antigen presentation—all features that may contribute to IBD pathogenesis [1].

In addition to the detection and clearance of intracellular pathogens, we recently revealed a role for ATG16L1 and NOD2 in sensing immunomodulatory commensal bacteria to promote tolerogenic immune responses to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Mouse dendritic cells deficient in either Atg16l1 or Nod2 were unable to induce regulatory T-cell responses to suppress mucosal inflammation upon treatment with Bacteroides fragilis, both in vitro and during experimental colitis [10]. Furthermore, immune cells from patients harboring the ATG16L1 risk allele T300A were unable to respond to B. fragilis in vitro compared to immune cells carrying the protective T300 allele, indicating that a functional ATG16L1 protein is required for the induction of anti-inflammatory responses by immunomodulatory bacterial molecules. Therefore, in addition to their role in bacterial clearance, we have proposed a complementary role for ATG16L1 and NOD2, in which these immune pathways also participate in the sensing of beneficial microbes [10]. Our work suggests that patients carrying risk alleles of IBD susceptibility genes may be cumulatively affected, first in sensing and clearance of intracellular microbes, and second in the recognition of immunomodulatory bacterial molecules from the gut microbiota to promote immune tolerance. Collectively, dysbiosis of the microbiome and the loss of beneficial commensal microbes, along with impairments in these IBD susceptibility genes, may lead to chronic, sustained mucosal inflammation, contributing to IBD pathogenesis.

# Conclusions

While host genetics and the gut microbiome have separately been considered to be contributing factors to host health and disease in various immune-mediated pathologies, it is now clear that the synergism between these two players is key to our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD. The intestinal microbial community has evolved alongside the host, contributing to immunity and energy metabolism [2]. Emerging studies have revealed that a
