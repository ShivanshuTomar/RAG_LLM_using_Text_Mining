healthy individuals. Intriguingly, they revealed that nearly 70–80% of the bacteria inhabiting the human gut were previously unknown and thus considered ‘unculturable’ at that time. Further studies then began to explore the differences in the gut microbiome in health and disease states while elucidating potential host–microbiome interactions and pathophysiological mechanisms.

# Metataxonomics: 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis

Most of the culture-independent characterization of the gut microbiome in IBD has been directed towards sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, which are present in all cellular organisms. This gene was chosen as it is relatively small (∼1.5 kb) and has a highly significant level of sequence conservation between bacterial species to facilitate reliable and robust alignments with sufficient variation to infer evolutionary relationships. Through barcoded primer sets that target highly conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene, metataxonomics seeks to amplify and subsequently sequence the hypervariable regions of the gene from bacteria and archaea within a given sample. The sequences are clustered into phylo-types according to their likeness to previously annotated sequences in a reference database or constructed into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by clustering sequences based on their similarity.

Metataxonomics provides a highly cost effective and rapid means of defining microbial community (16S rRNA genes for bacteria and 18S rRNA genes for eukaryotes) richness and semi-quantitative relative taxonomic abundance data. It also remains the primary technique for untargeted characterization of mucosally-adherent bacteria in the colon or other tissues that have a relatively low bacterial biomass. This technique is however known to be limited by the challenges associated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based short read length sequencing including GC bias, sequencing errors and difficulties in assessing OTUs. Furthermore, the characterization of closely related species by 16S rRNA gene is limited and resolution rarely differentiates strains of the same species. However, third generation approaches are starting to open up the possibility of species and strain-level metataxonomic approaches by combining the MinIon platform and longer amplicons. Unlike metagenomics, insights into the metabolic potential of a community cannot be obtained through a metataxonomic approach. Bioinformatics pipelines such as PICRUSt and Tax4Fun, however, allow predictions of the functional capability of a community based on a 16S rRNA gene dataset with significant metagenome correlation for biosamples obtained from the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

# Metagenomics

Metagenomics or ‘shotgun metagenomics’, refers to the untargeted sequencing of whole-community DNA in an environment. In a sample such as stool that consists of a complex microbial community, shotgun sequencing is primarily used to profile its taxonomic composition (down to the strain level) and directly identify functional potential. Unlike metataxonomics, rather than targeting a specific marker gene for amplification, all the extracted DNA in a given sample is sheared into small fragments, barcoded and independently sequenced. The resulting DNA sequences (or reads) are either assembled or left unassembled, and aligned to databases to provide accurate quantitative taxonomic and functional characterization. Consequently, metagenomics provides the opportunity to simultaneously explore two aspects of a microbial community; exactly who is there and what they are potentially capable of doing.

Metagenomics has enabled large-scale investigations of complex microbiomes and helped understand functional differences in healthy and diseased states. It provides strain-level resolution of gut bacteria and additionally characterizes non-bacterial microbial communities such as fungi and viruses that have recently been shown to potentially play a crucial role in host health. This technique, although powerful, does have many limitations: relatively, it is significantly more expensive than 16S rRNA gene sequencing; furthermore, there are many incompletely annotated bacterial genomic sequences, and uncertainties about the accuracy and even coverage of databases. As metagenomics bioinformatics tools rely on availability of annotated genomes they are therefore affected by limitations in reference sequence databases. Moreover, lack of annotations for a large number of microbial species when profiling metabolic potential leads to a bias towards highly conserved pathways (such as housekeeping genes), even when there are significant differences in the taxonomic composition.
