# Control arm

n = 36

- 4 doses of autologous FMT

# Outcomes

# Primary outcome

- Steroid-free clinical remission (Total Mayo ≤ 2, with no subscore > 1) assessed via sigmoidoscopy at week 8

# Secondary outcomes

- Steroid-free PRO-2 remission (combined Mayo subscores ≤ 1 for Rectal Bleeding + Stool Frequency) at week 8
- Steroid-free PRO-2 response (decrease of ≥ 3 points or ≥ 50% reduction from baseline (or both) in combined Mayo subscores for Rectal Bleeding + Stool Frequency) at week 8
- Steroid-free endoscopic remission (Mayo Endoscopy subscore ≤ 1) at week 8
- Steroid-free endoscopic response (Mayo Endoscopy subscore ≤ 1, with ≥ 1-point reduction from baseline) at week 8
