# Role of interleukin-6-mediated inflammation in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease

Macrophages and fibroblasts have been shown to induce fibrosis by releasing IL-6 and TGF-β as profibrotic cytokines (O'Reilly et al. 2014; Maier et al. 2017). Trans-IL-6 signaling increases collagen 1 synthesis by activating STAT3 and SMAD3 pathways and producing Gremlin-1 (O’Reilly 2021).

# Role of the IL‑6/IL‑6R axis in inflammatory bowel diseases

Evidence demonstrated that numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-17, IL-18, IL-33, IL-10, TNF-α, CCL2, and TGF-β are involved in the pathogenesis and development of IBD (McAlindon et al. 1998; Dinarello 1999, 2009; Pizarro et al. 1999; Kanai et al. 2001; Maerten et al. 2004; Schmitz et al. 2005; Beltrán et al. 2010; Kobori et al. 2010). IL-6 activates STAT3 signal transducer and activator, inducing an inflammatory response. It has been reported that the expression of IL-6 and its sIL-6R are amplified in CD and UC patients and reduced in IBD remission (Gross et al. 1992; Mitsuyama et al. 1995; Reinisch et al. 1999; Atreya and Neurath 2008; Bouguen et al. 2011; Pawłowska-Kamieniak et al. 2021). In addition, cohort studies showed higher levels of IL-6-mediated high-sensitivity CRP in patients with IBD (Lochhead et al. 2016). In patients with CAC, IL-6 also plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of CRC (Li et al. 2010). The clinical severity of CD and UC is associated with serum levels of TNF-α in patients with IBD patients. Moreover, TNF-α inducing the expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-33 plays a significant function in the pathogenesis of IBD (Murch et al. 1993; Sanchez-Muñoz et al. 2008). The IL-6 level is positively associated with the severity of histopathological and endoscopic manifestations, relapse frequency, and clinical disease activity in patients with CD (Reinisch et al. 1999; Van Kemseke et al. 2000; Atreya and Neurath 2008).

It appears that the major source of IL-6 in IBD are intestinal epithelial cells (IELs) and lamina propria mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), mesenchymal cells, and T cells (Kusugami et al. 1995; Atreya and Neurath 2008). Another function of IL-6 is the regulation of intestinal epithelial tight junctions (Suzuki et al. 2011). In this context, IL-6, by inducing claudin-2 in intestinal epithelial cells and pore formation, upsurges paracellular permeability for cations in a selective manner. It has been reported that signals of downstream IL-6 pathways such as MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT are responsible for initiating the pore formation processes (Lee 2015).

Most cell types can respond to IL-6 by shedding the sIL-6R and trans-signaling (Hunter and Jones 2015). T cell-mediated responses (Th1, Th2, and Th17) are important in the pathogenesis of IBD. IL-6 can induce cytokine secretion and survival of T cells by inducing antiapoptotic signals and molecules (Atreya et al. 2000). Moreover, it has been reported that intestinal T cell-mediated inflammation and T cell expansion could be attenuated by IL-6 blocking (Atreya et al. 2000; Yamamoto et al. 2000).

Nonetheless, this is not the whole story because IL-6 can be involved in regulating the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier and mucus secretion (Zhou and Sonnenberg 2018). In this regard, it has been shown that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), which are equivalent to Th17 in innate immunity, contribute to the integration of the intestinal epithelial barrier and homeostasis by secreting IL-6, IL-17, and IL-22 in response to commensal gut microbiota (Fung et al. 2016; Zhou and Sonnenberg 2018). The gut microbiome also can stimulate the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-23 by MNPs, resulting in IL-22 secretion by ILC3s and IL-6 production by IELs (Kuhn et al. 2018). Furthermore, IL-6 controls the balance between Tregs and pro-inflammatory T cells (Ye et al. 2020). As a result, intervention through IL-6/IL-6R inhibitors may not always be beneficial to treatment.

It has been revealed that stress can trigger the hypothalamus-pituitary axis (HPA) and activate the autonomic nervous system. Additionally, stress elevates cortisol levels and proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, resulting in chronic inflammation and IBD development. Increased IL-6 following acute or chronic stress increases intestinal permeability by weakening tight junctions. After increasing the permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier, the translocation of pathogenic bacteria to the colonic tissue increases and leads to infection, excessive cytokine release, and dysregulated inflammatory responses, which can be associated with the pathogenesis of IBD (Brzozowski et al. 2016). IL-6 also plays a role in the activation of colonic natural cytotoxicity receptor-positive (NCR +), CD4 − ILC3s in TRUC mice (mice with chronic inflamed intestine) by upregulation of IL-1α-induced production of IL-17A and IL-22 as well as IL-23 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Therefore, this axis might be targeted for treating patients with IBD (Powell et al. 2015).

Collectively, the production and secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-18 by IECs and MNPs can lead to chronic inflammation and the onset of colitis. However, in the case of IL-6 and IL-33, due to the dual role of these cytokines depending on the environmental signals and the stage of the disease, they may not be definitively involved in the pathogenesis and progression of IBD. Although IL-6 prevents T cell apoptosis in colitis and contributes to chronic.
