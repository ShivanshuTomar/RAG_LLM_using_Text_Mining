In this work, we used a systematic computational modeling workflow to investigate the bile acid production capabilities of gut microbes and gut microbial communities. After annotating and reconstructing the bile acid deconjugation and transformation pathways (Fig. 1a, Fig. 2) in 693 human gut microbe genomes, we first built pairwise microbial models providing novel insight into strain-specific bile-acid production capabilities. We then assembled gut microbiome models for each metagenomics sample of either healthy individuals or pediatric IBD patients. The three key results of our analysis are as follows: (1) microbes can complement each other’s bile acid pathway to achieve the broader bile acid production repertoire observed in fecal samples, (2) bile acid production profiles of 194 microbiome models were individual-specific and distinguished healthy controls from pediatric IBD patients, and (3) the bile acid production profiles could not be predicted by reaction (gene) abundance alone, as illustrated for Iso-CA illustrating the added value of computational modeling of metabolite production capabilities of microbial communities.

While it can be intuitively understood that bile acid biosynthesis is a cooperative task in the gut microbiome from the known fact that no strain possesses the complete pathway [23], these microbe-microbe metabolic dependencies could be exactly predicted through constraint-based modeling yielding more than 7000 pairs of microbes (Fig. 3a, Additional file 1: Table S5). The capabilities of most strains to generate secondary bile acids were shown to be very limited. For example, no strain alone but 100 pairs could convert tauro-or glyco-CDCA into UDCA (Additional file 1: Table S5). This analysis demonstrated that strain-specific microbe-microbe interactions need to be considered when studying the metabolic crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the mammalian host. Similar microbial corporations through cross-feeding of metabolic products have been suggested, e.g., for intestinal microbial metabolism of b-vitamins [43], of host-derived mucins [44], of dietary glycans [45], of flavonoids [46], for short-chain fatty acid production [41], and for microbial respiratory capabilities [47].

The personalized bile acid metabolism profile of 194 microbiomes, which included the total production potential and the strain-level contributions to overall production was individual-specific and distinct from healthy controls in pediatric IBD patients (Fig. 3b–d, Additional file 2: Figure S7). Our finding that the bile acid profiles of IBD patients differ from healthy controls agrees with experimental reports. For instance, a recent study has investigated the microbiomes and fecal metabolomes of pediatric IBD patients and their relatives and could distinguish two metabotypes both in patients and relatives [48]. The IBD-associated metabotype has been characterized by an altered bile acid profile, with increased levels of cholate and sulfated and taurine-conjugated primary bile acids. The altered bile acid profile suggests a reduced bile acid deconjugation and conversion potential of the gut microbiota [48], which we could demonstrate being the case with our in silico results (Fig. 3b–c).

In most analyzed microbiome models, the production potential for Iso-CA was found to be lower than expected from the abundance of the 3β-HSDH. Analyzing the shadow prices [7] revealed that the presence of strains capable of synthesizing the precursor 3-dehydro-CA was a bottleneck in many microbiomes. In fact, we identified four scenarios, for which different strategies could be used to increase overall Iso-CA production capabilities in a given microbiome. In these four scenarios, Iso-CA production flux could be increased (1) only by directly providing it, (2) by increasing the abundance of strains carrying 3β-HSDH, (3) either by providing 3-dehydro-CA or by increasing the abundance of strains carrying 3α-HSDH, and (4) by increasing the abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus ATCC 29149 and in some cases Eggerthella lenta DSM 2243. To complete the systems biology cycle, these predictions require experimental validation, e.g., by measuring the amount of Iso-CA levels in in vitro cultures from fecal samples. A shadow price analysis has the advantage of being an unbiased indicator for metabolites in a pathway that are of key importance for the end product of the pathway. It could be readily applied to other health-relevant metabolites produced by the gut microbiome (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and key synthesis-limiting steps in the relevant pathways.

Compared with commonly used computational and multivariate statistical approaches, the constraint-based modeling approach applied in this study has several key advantages. First of all, unlike quantifications of total gene abundance (e.g., [49]) and correlation-based approaches (e.g., [50]), our approach is mechanistic and obeys physicochemical and environmental constraints (e.g., mass-charge conservation, laws of thermodynamics, substrate uptake). This property enabled us to predict the metabolic capabilities of a given microbial community, as defined by metagenomics data. Importantly, the predicted capabilities are physiologically, physicochemically, and thermodynamically feasible under the
