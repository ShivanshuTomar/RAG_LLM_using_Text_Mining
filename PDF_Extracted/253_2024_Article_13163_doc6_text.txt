genes did not induce significant toxicity or inhibit growth of the bacterial EcN strains (Supplemental Fig. S2). ELISA and Western blot analysis confirmed that both anti-TNF-α nanobody and IL-10 were detectable in the culture medium of EcN-TNFαNb and EcN-IL10 strains over a time-dependent period from 6 to 12 h (Fig. 2D–E). Standard curves were presented in the Supplemental Fig. S3. In summary, our study successfully establishes a robust platform for sustained expression of therapeutic drugs in EcN.

# Engineered EcN ameliorates disease activity in mice with DSS‑induced colitis

As it is known, IBD is notoriously challenging to cure and prone to frequent recurrences, so we have devised a prophylactic strategy aimed at mitigating the risk of recurrence among patients with colitis. The limited gut colonization ability of EcN as a probiotic (Zou et al. 2023) prompted us to administer gavage every 24 h for 7 consecutive days, ensuring continual delivery of engineered bacteria to the intestine. Specifically, mice were orally administered PBS, EcN (containing the α-hemolysin secretion system), EcN-TNFaNb, EcN-IL10, and EcN-TNFαNb + EcN-IL10 daily for 2 days prior to DSS intake and throughout the subsequent 5 days of DSS treatment period (Fig. 3A). As anticipated, both the PBS (DSS +) group and the EcN (DSS +) group displayed a considerable weight reduction of approximately 10% during the final 2 days of DSS treatment (Fig. 3B). However, mice treated with constitutive engineered bacteria also exhibited a reduction in body weight, potentially attributed to the high expression of drug proteins in constitutive strains, leading to certain toxicity towards the mice.

The mice were euthanized on the seventh day for a colon examination, as the colon length serves as an indicator of the severity of inflammation. Notably, the colons of mice in the EcN-TNFαNb + EcN-IL10 (DSS +) group displayed a significant increase in length (approximately 1.5 cm) compared to those of diseased mice (PBS DSS +) (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the combination of two engineered bacteria mitigated disease progression. In terms of colon condition, DSS + mice treated with EcN-TNFaNb, EcN-IL10, and EcN-TNFαNb + EcN-IL10 demonstrated substantial relief from colon shortening along with reduced areas of congestion and edema (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, when compared to single engineered bacteria treatment, the combination therapy resulted in more complete fecal shape within the colon (Fig. 3C). Compared with the mice given PBS, mice given engineered EcN were lively in spirit and reacted normally to the outside world. Hematochezia and soft stools were alleviated. The HE staining was employed to assess the impact of the engineered bacteria on gut inflammation. Histological imaging of DSS-treated mice (PBS DSS +) clearly revealed cell infiltration and epithelial exfoliation, while the EcN-IL10 (DSS+) and EcN-TNFαNb + EcN-IL10 (DSS +) group exhibited reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and maintained satisfactory colorectal integrity (Fig. 3E).

Additionally, a histology activity index was utilized to assess the ulcer count, epithelial cell alterations, and inflammatory infiltration. When compared to the inflammation group (PBS DSS +), the group receiving the combination of engineered bacteria exhibited a noteworthy decrease in the activity index score (Fig. 3F). The disease activity index (DAI) of the EcN-TNFαNb + EcN-IL10 (DSS+) group was significantly lower compared to the inflammation group (PBS DSS+) (Fig. 3G). To further investigate the mechanisms behind the observed improvements, the levels of anti-TNF-α nanobody and IL-10 were quantified in mouse feces during DSS-induced colitis. The mice received daily oral administration of EcN, EcN-TNFαNb, EcN-IL10, and EcN-TNFαNb + EcN-IL10 (5 × 109 CFU) for 2 days prior to DSS intake and throughout the 5 days period of DSS intake. Fecal samples were collected from each group of mice on the 7th day. The levels of TNF-α Nb and IL-10 were quantified by ELISA and were determined by subtracting the levels detected in the EcN (DSS +) group from those measured in the EcN-TNFαNb, EcN-IL10, and EcN-TNFαNb + EcN-IL10 groups. Our findings revealed that on the 7th day, the concentrations of anti-TNF-α nanobody and IL-10 in the feces of the mice belonging to the EcN-TNFαNb + EcN-IL10 (DSS +) group were 822.8 ng/g and 376 ng/g respectively (Fig. 3H–I).

To assess the impact of EcN-TNFαNb, EcN-IL10, and EcN-TNFαNb + EcN-IL10 on inflammatory factors, the levels of four cytokines were quantified. Notably, in the PBS (DSS+) group treated with EcN-TNFαNb + EcN-IL10, the concentrations of these cytokines were lower than in the PBS (DSS −) group (Fig. 3J–M). Moreover, the EcN (DSS+) group exhibited a significant decrease in the levels of the four cytokines in the colon compared to the inflammation group (PBS DSS+). These findings indicated that EcN alone possesses a positive effect on IBD without the need of drug protein intervention. The cytokine levels observed in the EcN-TNFαNb + EcN-IL10 (DSS+) group did not significantly differ from those in the EcN (DSS+) group. However, treatment with either EcN-TNFαNb or EcN-IL10 alone demonstrated inferior efficacy to combined treatment with both agents (Fig. 3J–M). These results indicated that engineered bacteria expressing anti-TNF-α nanobody and IL-10 are crucial and effective components for treating inflammation alongside the probiotic role of EcN.

The constitutive excretion of drugs at high concentrations may potentially lead to adverse effects, such as fibrosis at the site of injury (Zou et al. 2023). To validate the efficacy of this system in preventing fibrosis formation, collagen proportionate areas were analyzed in different treatment groups using Masson’s trichrome staining of colon sections as a marker for fibrosis. The results demonstrated that the
