the two primary subgroups of IBD patients (UC and CD) [Figure 2B]. Interestingly, the populations of Firmicutes did not manifest obvious changes between the two primary subgroups of IBD patients (UC and CD) [Figure 2B]. The ratio of Bacteroidetes was lower in primary non-responders compared with responders. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed a strong positive correlation in gut microbiota composition between responder and non-responder IBD patients [Figure 2C]. Furthermore, an independent t-test showed no statistically significant difference between the relative abundance of predominant phyla of gut microbiota in response to anti-TNF-α treatment between the two IBD patient groups [Figures 3 and S1].

Independent samples t-test statistically showing phyla of the gut microbiota. All P values were non-significant for responders (R=blue) and primary non-responders (P=purple) to anti-TNF-α therapies.

At the phylum level, the fecal microbiota of primary non-responders were characterized by the increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria [Figure 2A]. Several SCFA-producing bacteria were omitted in unresponsive patients (primary non-responders). These included Anaerostipes, Coprococcus,
