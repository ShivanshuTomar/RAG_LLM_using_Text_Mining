# Introduction

UC mostly involves inflammation to the rectum and colon, whereas CD most often affects the terminal ileum and colon though in some cases it can affect any part of the GI tract [2, 5]. Currently, there is no full cure for IBD, but different treatments such as taking steroids, immunosuppressants, liquid diet or surgery can help in reducing the symptoms [5]. To date, the exact cause of IBD is not understood, however, a combination of genetic variants, environmental factors, deregulated host immune system, and gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with IBD [6â€“16].

More than 215 IBD-associated loci have been identified so far from various genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [7]. It has been reported that a large percentage (~ 30%) of these loci are common between CD and UC, showing involvement of common biological processes in both conditions [14, 17]. Moreover, these IBD-associated loci are mostly involved with immune system deregulation, a process which the gut microbiome has also been implicated in [18]. The gut microbiota, which has a complex community of a hundred trillion bacterial and archaeal cells comprising more than a thousand species, provides benefits to the host such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and amino acids, metabolism of undigested carbohydrate, and stimulation of the immune system [19, 20]. In patients with IBD, the structure and the composition of the gut microbiota is severely altered compared to that of a healthy condition [10, 13, 18, 21].

Previous work has reported imbalances in IBD patients for the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes at the phylum level, and Ruminococcaceae, Veillonellaceae, Christensenellaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Rikenellaceae at the family level. However, there is a large degree of variability across studies, with many reporting contradictory findings. In particular, it is unclear what the relationship is between microbial groups when there is inflammation of the gut epithelium during various diseased states. There is furthermore, a general knowledge gap in establishing the relationships between microbial groups across different disease conditions.

The aim of the current work was to investigate the relationships between changing microbial groups in IBD. In particular, we wanted to understand which microbial groups differ during IBD, and how these groups differ in co-abundance patterns across a variety of diseases at the global scale. To do this, we initially investigated the gut microbial imbalance, at different taxonomic levels for healthy volunteers and CD and UC patients. We next reconstructed a network of the co-abundance patterns of different bacterial groups using publicly available data from a variety of studies at a global scale. Our results indicate that the bacterial groups which increase in abundance during IBD are specific to both CD and UC conditions. In comparison, bacterial groups which did not change in abundance during different disease states are well connected in global networks, giving us a better understanding of the dynamics of the microbiome in both health and disease.

# Results and discussion

# Gut microbial richness in IBD patients

We collected faecal samples from 30 individuals (9 CD patients, 11 UC patients and 10 healthy volunteers) and performed 16S rRNA taxonomic profiling to understand changes in community structure during disease with resulting data analysed using the DADA2 pipeline. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were used as a measure of diversity. As previously reported, species richness in the gut of IBD patients (both CD and UC) was lower than that of healthy volunteers [10, 13]. Moreover, within the IBD patients groups, the gut of CD patients exhibit substantially lower species richness than that of UC patients (Fig. 1a). As a measure of diversity, we identified a total of 2261 ASVs, of which 81% belong to the Firmicutes, 9.25% Bacteroidetes, 5.13% Proteobacteria, and 3.14% ASVs are from Actinobacteria. Combined, these four phyla constitute more than 98% of the total identified ASVs [22, 23].

To understand how this compared to other studies, we investigated the global microbial species-richness in the human gut across > 22,000 samples from 113 different studies from a variety of conditions (EBI metagenomics accession numbers [1] in Additional file 1: Table S1). We have considered only the known species in each study and made a unique list of gut bacterial species across studies. Similar to our experimental observations, the four phyla including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria comprised > 94% of the total diversity in the gut, with the Firmicutes being the most species-rich phylum across conditions (Fig. 1b). However, the number of species identified as belonging to the Firmicute Phyla in our dataset (81% of all identified species from 20 IBD and 10 healthy condition samples) is substantially higher than what is usually reported at a global level (38.18%). As the observation comes from 2/3 of IBD patient and 1/3 of healthy control samples, this increased level of Firmicutes species-richness was attributed to the high number of IBD samples. Analysis of global studies for species-richness of Proteobacteria demonstrated this phyla usually accounts for 31.18% of all species, however this was substantially lower in our dataset (5.13%). Finally, the richness of Bacteroidetes was also reduced in our dataset compared to the global datasets (9.24% in our study compared to 14.35% globally). We find a similar observation when considering all OTUs from individual EBI gut microbiome studies (Additional file 2: Figure S1).
