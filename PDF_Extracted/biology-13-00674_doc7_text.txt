# 4. The Influence of Dietary Salt on IBD

# 4.1. Effects of High-Salt Diet on Intestinal Microbiota in IBD

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is typified by intestinal inflammation, which is chronic and relapsing. Recently, it has become a significant global health concern with a consistently rising prevalence [11]. Based on projections derived from the 2020 United States Census, it is estimated that approximately 2.39 million individuals in the United States have been diagnosed with IBD [55]. Furthermore, the incidence of IBD in China was 10.04 per 100,000 person-years in 2016 [56].

The etiology of IBD remains incompletely understood [57], but alterations in the gut microbiota have been identified as playing a role in the pathogenesis of IBD [58]. For example, the levels of bacteria such as Clostridia, Ruminococcaceae, Lactobacillus, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii have been found to be lower in patients with IBD, while Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium species have been found to be higher in the same patients [59]. Furthermore, alterations in the abundance of fungal microorganisms, such as Candida albicans strains, which constitute an integral component of the gut microbial ecosystem, have also been observed in the direct effects of a high-salt diet on host immune homeostasis in IBD [60, 61]. In conclusion, the altered abundances of these gut microbes represent a significant factor in the pathogenesis of IBD. By comparing the changes in the intestinal microbiota in IBD and high dietary salt, some similarities can be found.

For example, a combined study of sequencing and the proteome conducted by Wang C. et al. revealed that Ruminococcus levels rise after a high-sodium diet [29]. Similarly, a multi-omics study conducted by Lloyd-Price J. et al. revealed that the abundance of Ruminococcus was elevated in patients diagnosed with UC and CD [39]. Despite the absence of direct evidence indicating that an elevated salt consumption influences the prevalence of Ruminococcus and, consequently, impacts IBD, we can hypothesize about the potential involvement of Ruminococcus in the association between a high-salt diet and IBD based on the findings of these two studies.

In conclusion, an investigation into the effects of a high-salt diet on the gut microbiota and alterations in the gut microbiota observed in patients with IBD may help to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for the microbiological treatment of IBD and enhance our comprehension of the influence of diet on IBD.

# 4.2. Direct Effects of High-Salt Diet on Host Immune Homeostasis in IBD

The etiology of IBD remains largely unidentified. However, it is understood that a complex interaction between genetic, environmental, and microbial factors, in conjunction with immune responses, is involved. Moreover, a significant body of evidence derived from a multitude of studies substantiates the correlation between an elevated salt consumption and augmented intestinal inflammation [62–65] (Figure 3).

Kleinewietfeld M. found that an elevated dietary salt intake may potentially serve as an environmental risk factor for the onset of autoimmune disorders by fostering the proliferation of pathogenic Th17 cells [66]. As a CD4 T cell subset, Th17 cells have been demonstrated to play a dual role in the etiology of IBD, primarily exerting a proinflammatory effect. An animal model demonstrated that an elevated intake of salt can prompt the proliferation of Th17 cells’ differentiation within the small intestine, leading to the accumulation of Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria (LP) of the distal small intestine and increased IL-17 in both the intestine and plasma IL-17 levels [67]. IL-17, as a Th17-derived cytokine, plays a significant role in the chronic inflammatory processes that can up-regulate the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, which underpin the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as IBD [68]. Furthermore, IL-17 has been evidenced
