|Bias Type|Risk|Quote|
|---|---|---|
|Allocation concealment (selection bias)|Low risk|"To ensure masking, placebo capsules were double encapsulated to replicate the lyophilised capsules and were indistinguishable from FMT capsules by taste, smell, or colour, and were stored in identical coded packaging. Packaged capsules were then dispensed to the patient by a separate investigator who was unaware of the treatment allocation … Endoscopic images and histology were both read centrally by an expert gastroenterologist and histopathologist, respectively, masked to the treatment allocation." (page 143)|
|Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)|Low risk|"To ensure masking, placebo capsules were double encapsulated to replicate the lyophilised capsules and were indistinguishable from FMT capsules by taste, smell, or colour, and were stored in identical coded packaging. Packaged capsules were then dispensed to the patient by a separate investigator who was unaware of the treatment allocation. We assessed the placebo preparation on two study investigators (CH and RWL) who were not able to distinguish between the preparations. Study investigators who played a part in patients' assessment did not see the investigational product at any time. At 8 weeks, investigators and patients were unmasked after the end of treatment sigmoidoscopy." (page 143)|
|Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)|Low risk|"Endoscopic images and histology were both read centrally by an expert gastroenterologist and histopathologist, respectively, masked to the treatment allocation." (page 143)|
|Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)|Low risk|Comment: mITT analysis used; all randomized participants were included in induction follow-up 8 weeks after commencing FMT. (page 145)|
|Selective reporting (reporting bias)|Low risk|Comment: all intended outcomes were reported in the paper; trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Trial Registry (ACTRN 12619000611123).|
|Other bias|Low risk|Comment: no other risk of bias noted.|
