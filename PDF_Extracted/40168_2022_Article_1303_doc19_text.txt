SCFA concentrations, suggesting beneficial action in protecting intestinal barrier in Min pigs. Growing evidence suggests host-microbiota interaction has been linked to IBD disease progression; thus, the results of this study may contribute to screening for core intestinal microbial candidates associated with host health and support a shift in thinking about anti-inflammatory strategies from improving immunity to immunosuppression.
