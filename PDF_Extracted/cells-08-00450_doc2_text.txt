# 3. Diet as A Modulator of Gut Microbiota and Their Metabolites

Increasing evidence suggests that the diet influences the composition of the gut microbiome and the metabolites produced by the microflora. Indeed, breastfed infants develop a different gut microbiota, at initial colonization, compared to infants fed with a formula diet [20]. The inhibition of the immune response, during colonization, may predispose people to colitis susceptibility, allergy, and cancer later in life [21]. In adults, dietary patterns have been proposed to alter the composition of the intestinal microbiome [22]. The major variation of gut microbiota is related to dietary changes, indicating the dominant role of diet in shaping bacterial composition [23, 24]. In IBD patients, the occurrence of dysbiosis has been observed. A high-fat and low-fiber diet can lead to dysbiosis in healthy volunteers [25, 26], indicating that the diet is a major determinant of the microbiota. A vegetarian diet rich in fibers prevents the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as E. coli, in human-mediated by the production of SCFA, which decreases the intestinal pH [27]. In mice, a dietary haem iron, which is associated with changes in the gut microbiota, [28] induces oxidative stress-mediated colonic epithelium injuries [29]. Moreover, the switch from a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet to a high-fat, high-sugar "Western" diet, may cause a dysbiosis [30], indicating that there are multiple forms of diets that can influence the composition of the microbiota, with a potential impact on the development of intestinal diseases. Thus, a deeper understanding of receptors that recognize microbial-derived metabolites may help to identify factors leading to IBD.

# 4. GPCRs Sense Microbial-Derived Metabolites

Metabolite-sensing GPCRs can bind to metabolites derived from consumed foods. These metabolites are produced either, by direct host metabolism, or digestion, such as MCFAs (derived from coconut, palm kernel, and milk), LCFAs (derived from olive oil and fish), niacin and kynurenic acid (intermediates of tryptophan metabolism by the host) or by secondary metabolites after gut bacterial fermentation. These include, for example, SCFAs (derived from fermentation of fiber diet by gut flora) and indole-3-aldehyde (derived from bacterial metabolism of tryptophan).

SCFAs are generated mostly in the colon from undigested carbohydrates, including plant polysaccharides and soluble oligosaccharides after fermentation by the anaerobic microbiota community [31, 32]. The major products are acetate (C-2), propionate (C-3), and butyrate (C-4) [33, 34]. Protein fermentations may also contribute to SCFAs production [35]. However, carbohydrates are the most significant sources. The synthesis of the three SCFAs acetate (C-2), propionate (C-3), and butyrate (C-4) depends on the composition of the microbiota and environmental conditions, such as pH, available substrates, and hydrogen partial pressure [36, 37]. SCFAs are transported by monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 (SMCT1) across the cell membrane of epithelial cells into the host. Butyrate can be used as a significant energy source by colonocytes and is primarily metabolized within the epithelial mucosa. Acetate travels intact to the liver and then it is released into systemic circulation [38]. Propionate exhibits an average distribution [11]. MCFAs are used mainly by the liver as a source of energy after absorption through the duodenum. Enterocytes take-up LCFAs and esterify LCFAs into complex lipids to serve as an integral part of the cell membrane, as a metabolic fuel, as precursors of lipid mediators, as regulators of ion-channels, and as modulators of gene expression [39].

Moreover, tryptophan metabolites derived from the host and microbiota metabolism bind to metabolite-sensing GPCRs. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid required for protein biosynthesis. Also, tryptophan functions as a precursor for serotonin, an important neurotransmitter synthesized in the gut and in the brain. The liver regulates tryptophan metabolism by the degradation of excess tryptophan. In the intestine, tryptophan metabolites such as kynurenine, indole-3-aldehyde, and indole-3-acetic are known to regulate inflammation by acting on the adaptive immunity and the intestinal barrier.
