Another environmental, lifestyle-related factor is smoking, which has been shown to cause a two-fold increased risk for IBD [51]. Besides affecting the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors present on gastrointestinal mucosal epithelial cells [52], smoking can modulate the human gut microbiota composition, thereby affecting the course of the disease in IBD. Although in the context of Crohn’s disease, smoking has adverse effects, in ulcerative colitis patients, it may play a protective role, implying that smoking may be a disease-specific modifier [53].

As mentioned, dietary fiber intake is able to prolong IBD remission through subsequent increase in luminal production of short-chain fatty acids [31, 54]. In addition, it is well-established that high intake of fat- and sugar-enriched foods are capable of regulating intestinal microbiota composition and diversity [55, 56], thereby also initiating and sustaining inflammation in patients with IBD [57]. Furthermore, high intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and plant sterols have been shown to be protective [58], suggesting that dietary changes play a role in IBD pathogenesis.

It is also well known that low-to-moderate intensity exercise positively affects immune function [59]. Indeed, preclinical studies showed that moderate intensity exercise decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby improving acute colitis [60]. Human data regarding the beneficial effects of exercise on the development of intestinal inflammation are mixed, mainly due to the variations in type and rate of exercise. Several studies suggested an inversed correlation between physical activity and the risk or onset of IBD [61]; however, these effects have shown to be disease specific [62]. Nevertheless, other studies focusing on the association between exercise and disease course or the quality of life of IBD patients found a beneficial effect on well-being, sleep, confidence, and mood [63, 64].

Further evidence also suggests that geographic location and socioeconomic status are associated with the risk of IBD, thereby supporting the “hygiene hypothesis” of Bloomfield [65]. This hypothesis postulates that the recent rapid rise in IBD, especially in industrialized regions [66], may be due to the lower rate of infection during childhood. The lower infection rate may evolve from reduced exposure to enteric bacteria and improved sanitation during early life [67]. Although this reasoning might indeed explain the higher incidence of IBD in urban areas, the environmental location has been shown to differently affect the prevalence of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Whereas Crohn’s disease has shown to be more frequent in urban/coastal areas, ulcerative colitis is more prevalent in inland municipalities [68].

Given that the gut microbiota is relatively diverse and unstable during early childhood, any kind of alteration is likely to affect the intestinal immune responses and predispose individuals to IBD. For instance, medications, including antibiotics, contraceptives as well as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to increase the risk of IBD, likely through altering the commensal flora and/or the intestinal barrier [69]. More specifically, based on a meta-analysis, antibiotics were shown to associate with increased risk of new-onset Crohn’s disease rather than ulcerative colitis [70]. In line, a multiple database search revealed that individuals exposed to oral contraceptives had a 24% and 30% increased risk for developing Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, respectively, compared with those not exposed to the medication [71]. Likewise, high doses and long-term treatments with NSAIDs [72] resulted in the exacerbation of IBD [73], potentially acting via non-selective inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase [74].

Relevantly, IBD disease activity and its risk of relapse has also been associated with sleep disturbances [75]. Sleep disturbances can induce the levels of inflammatory cytokines, thereby activating an inflammatory cascade [76]. Furthermore, sleep disturbances have been shown to occur in IBD patients, including pediatric patients [77] as well as those with inactive disease [78], and can negatively impact quality of life. Indeed, optimized sleep duration (i.e., six to nine hours/day) was able to decrease the risk of ulcerative colitis. Further, based on a prospective study, a strong inversed correlation between sleep quality and the activity of IBD was demonstrated [79]. Also, disruptions of the circadian organization, a form of long-term biological stress, are known to affect health [80]. It has been suggested that the adverse effects of the host’s circadian rhythm, including sleep disruption, can alter the circadian rhythm of the intestinal microbiota, thereby changing its community structure [80].
