# Exosomes

Exosomes consist of varying compositions of macromolecules mainly proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and lipids. Studies on exosomes from different sources indicate that they share common exosomal constituents. There are currently 41,860 exosomal protein, >7540 exosomal RNA, and 1116 exosomal lipid molecules documented from more than 286 exosome-based studies annotated using the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles minimal experimental requirements for definition of EVs (Keerthikumar et al., 2016). To date, some of the common and cell-type-specific exosomal proteins documented include the Ras superfamily of monomeric G proteins (Rab), adhesion molecules, heat shock proteins (such as HSC73, HSC90), annexins I, II, V and VI, cytoskeletal proteins (synenin, actin, moesin, albumin), tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, CD81, CD82), and GTPases (Ferguson & Nguyen, 2016; Samanta et al., 2018). However, a recent study that reassessed exosome composition reported that cytoskeletal proteins, glycolytic enzymes, and argonaute 1–4 are not detected in exosomes. They further demonstrated that small EVs are not vehicles of active DNA release, but rather, extracellular DNAs are secreted via an autophagy and multivesicular-endosome-dependent but exosome-independent mechanism (Jeppesen et al., 2019).

Lipids found in exosomal compositional studies include cholesterol, phospholipids (e.g. phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine), diglycerides, glycerophospholipids, arachidonic acid (polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid), and sphingolipids like ceramide and sphingomyelin. Compared to the parental cell, lipids are found in exosomes at ratios up to fourfold higher, which could possibly explain the increased membrane rigidity of exosomes. Furthermore, specific bioactive lipids are found in exosomes, particularly leukotrienes, prostaglandin, and activated enzymes of lipid metabolism (Subra et al., 2010; Skotland, Sandvig, & Llorente, 2017; Skotland et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019).

In addition to these proteins and lipids, several exosomal RNAs have also been reported. These RNAs encapsulated in the exosome mainly participate in cell cycle progression, cellular migration, angiogenesis, or histone modification. Exosomal miRNA takes part in modulating gene expression in relation to stem cell differentiation, haematopoiesis, organogenesis, tumorigenesis and tumour metastasis (Zhang et al., 2015a; Isola & Chen, 2016; Kalluri, 2016). An exosomal RNA database reports 18,333 mRNAs, 58,330 circular RNAs (circRNAs), and 15,501 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (Li et al., 2018a). Studies have been carried out on the role of these exosomal long RNA species (mRNAs, circRNAs, and lncRNAs) in tumour formation and progression with a focus on their use as potential targets in the diagnosis and treatment of tumours (Zhou et al., 2018b). Statello et al. (2018) report that certain RNA binding proteins (RBPs) serve as key players in transporting RNAs into exosomes. They demonstrate the presence of 30 RBPs in exosomes that interact with RNAs to form RNA–RBP complexes with both exosomal RNAs and cellular RNAs. The RNA–RBP complexes were found within the exosomes in the form of RNA–ribonucleoprotein complexes (Statello et al., 2018). Figure 2 summarizes the available information on the sources and composition of exosomes.

# III. SOURCES OF EXOSOMES

Selection of the source of exosomes for therapy is of great importance because the constituents of the exosome, including its surface proteins and lipids, play vital roles in their functions. The surface markers on the source cells should also be studied to understand their biological characteristics since they could jeopardize the expected outcome and negatively impact the recipient.

# (1) Stem cells

Stem cell-derived exosomes contribute to the self-renewal, immunomodulatory, expansion and damage repair abilities of stem cells. Thus, stem cell-derived exosomes have demonstrated significant therapeutic benefits in several diseases. Mao et al. (2017a) showed that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes could relieve the symptoms of IBD and helped in the recovery of damaged tissues and organs.

# (2) Food

Recently, exosomes from food such as fruits have received interest based on the fact that these exosomes are frequently ingested, and thus are generally considered safe. These edible plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles are known to possess anti-inflammatory properties and contain microRNAs that are crucial in the mediation of pathological and physiological activities in both animals and plants. Xiao et al. (2018) identified several such nanovesicles from 11 edible vegetables and fruits. Upon analysis, it was revealed that they had a close association with the inflammatory response and cancer-related pathways and were capable of regulating human mRNA (Xiao et al., 2018). Exosome-like nanoparticles were isolated in another study from coconut water and other food items, with diameters smaller than those of animal-derived exosomes (Zhao et al., 2018). Some of these food-derived vesicles have been applied in experimental animal models with encouraging outcomes, although no clinical trials have been published to date.

# (3) Immune cells

Exosomes derived from immune cells have also attracted intense research interest. They have been applied in vaccine and drug-delivery studies and have produced significant therapeutic outcomes (Cheng, Wang, & Huang, 2017; Jiang & Gao, 2017). Macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) are key immune cells from which exosomes have been derived for therapeutic studies. Immune cell-derived exosomes have been proved to evade the immune system and escape clearance, thereby extending their circulation period and therapeutic impact.
