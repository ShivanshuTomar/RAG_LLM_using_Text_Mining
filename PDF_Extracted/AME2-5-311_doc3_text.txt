Th17 cells in response to TNBS exposure. Thus TNBS-induced colitis comprises two forms of IBD and predominantly captures many features of CD. The recommended dosage for the induction of acute colitis involves intrarectal injection of 0.5–40 mg once, and clinical symptoms may arise 5–7 days after rectal administration. In addition, continuous intrarectal administration of TNBS is often used to develop chronic colitis model, characterized by increased mucosal thickness, loss of goblet cells, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. In addition, strains of mouse should be considered as SJL/J, C3HeJ, and BALB/c are susceptible strains, whereas C57BL/6 and DBA/2 are resistant ones (Table 1).

Acetic acid–induced colitis is easy to manipulate and is also commonly employed in IBD research, and the operational processor is quite similar to that of TNBS-induced colitis. Rectal administration of acetic acid–induced colitis shares common histopathological characteristics with those of UC patients, including transmural necrosis, edema, submucosal ulceration, and depletion of goblet cells, which is another well-established mouse model for UC. Colitis was induced by rectal instillation of 1 mL of 0.9% saline-diluted acetic acid (4%–5%) with a catheter into the lumen of colon 4 cm proximal to the anus. Mice were maintained in a supine Trendelenburg position for 30 s to prevent the leakage of the acetic acid solution. Mucosal injury was related to the epithelia necrosis and edema, whose severity depended on the dose and duration of exposure time of acetic acid. Chemical destruction of colonic epithelium starts within 4 h and spontaneously heals within days in mice. Inflammatory responses contribute to the aggravated colonic mucosal damage via activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signal pathway, infiltration of immune cells, and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS). By contrast, the epithelial injury in the first 24 h is possibly induced by the protonated form of the acid, which liberates protons instead of immune responses, which indicates that choosing a proper time point 24 h post-induction is crucial when exploring the immunologic mechanisms.

C. rodentium, widely used as a model to study infection-induced colitis, is a gram-negative and mouse-restricted enteric pathogen belonging to the attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogen family, which also includes human enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). The colonization process of A/E family pathogens is achieved by forming the A/E lesions: intimate adherence to IECs, effacement of the brush border microvilli, and reorganization of the host actin cytoskeleton to form pedestal-like extensions. C. rodentium-induced colitis is one of the rare models of infectious colitis that has been extensively studied and characterized since the discovery and use of this bacterium. In addition, C. rodentium-induced colitis is also an outstanding in vivo model to investigate host–pathogen interactions in human IBD, as it shares 67% of its genes with both EHEC and EPEC, including locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. Upon forming the A/E lesions, C. rodentium serves as a pathogen by injecting effector proteins into host cell via the type III secretion system (T3SS), which is considered as the main pathogenesis of infection. C. rodentium-induced colitis is casually established by oral administration, followed by a robust Th1/Th17 immune response, thus leading to transmissible murine crypt hyperplasia (TMCH) primarily in the distal large intestine. Some mice strains can spontaneously clear this bacterium and heal in 21–28 days post-infection, whereas C. rodentium is fatal to other strains. Commonly used colitis models of C. rodentium are summarized in Table 1.

The chemically induced models are widely used in IBD investigation for their convenience in conducting the experiments; however, they have self-limitations. Because the inflammatory responses come after the epithelium damage, this may not be a preferred model when exploring the dysbiosis as short-time colitis possibly cannot reflect true changes in intestinal microbiota in long-term IBD process. The C. rodentium-induced colitis model is a rare model suitable for investigating host–pathogen immune interactions in the gut, which represents the TMCH without epithelial destruction. In addition to the IBD models described earlier, there are also numerous mouse IBD models, such as the adoptive transfer and genetically deficient models. These models, combined with the introduced ones in this section, have greatly facilitated the investigation of IBD.
