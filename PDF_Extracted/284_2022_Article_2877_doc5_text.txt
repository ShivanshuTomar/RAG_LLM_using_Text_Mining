# Upper and Lower Respiratory Tract Microbiome

Lung microbiome is dynamically transient ecosystem; its microflora basically builds from inhaling air, oral sphere, and micro-aspiration. Most frequent phyla are observed as, Protobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. However, the genus Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacteria, Porphyromonas, and Veillonella have been mainly studied [31] (Table 1). A study based on 16S rRNA sequence of lung tissues of deceased patients reported that Acinetobacter was the most common bacterial genus followed by Chryseobacterium, Burkholderia, Brevundimonas, Sphingobium and Enterobacteriaceae. Cryptococcus, Issatchenkia, Wallemia, Cladosporium and Alternaria are the prevalent fungi identified. Another case study reported the co-infection of Capnocytophaga and Veillonella spp. with unknown pathogenicity were obtained from two COVID-19 patients [3, 34].

de Mai et al. [33], noticed the resilience in the bacterial community of nasopharynx belong to the phyla micutes, Bacteroidetes, Protobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria. Global functional profiling has shown that 44 coded enzymes characterized in COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients and healthy controls [36]. Metaproteome study has revealed the EC features in the COVID-19 respiratory samples with increasing activity of diaminopimelate decarboxylase. But glycan biosynthesis, lipid and sphingolipid metabolisms were limited. Less alpha-gal contents supported the negative correlation between anti-gal antibody titres and COVID-19 severity. In addition, bacteria associated with lesser content of host glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate modification were linked to COVID-19 susceptibility [36]. This specific area that needed to be explored in regard to enzymes/ proteins regulating microbial functions is yet to be discovered.

# Gut‑Lung Axis Dysbiosis to Facilitate Chronic Disorders

The microbe-mediated cross talk along the gut-lung axis has been evidenced by intestinal barrier disruption, spread of microbes, endotoxins and other metabolites could increase the severity events of COVID-19. Most of the immune cells and microbiota in the intestine play an important role in regulating the immune response. Altered gut microbiota can enhance the etiologies of metabolic, neurodegenerative, non-communicable disorders and infectious diseases. It’s role in affecting the metabolic system is yet to be elucidated [3, 36–39]. COVID-19 severity enhanced by altered microbiota led to the secondary pulmonary infections, by establishing the regular fecal–oral route to regularize them [21].

Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia and Faecalbacterium in human neonatal microbiome are linked with high risk of childhood atopy and asthma [40]. Respiratory influenza infection caused the intestinal injury and subsequent change in gut microbiome composition with increased number of microbes from Enterobacteriaceae with concomitant decrease in Lactobacillus and Lactococcus [41]. Hence, IBD is associated with pulmonary diseases [42].

Inflammatory response in type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, coronary heart disease and age-related disorders, are involved with comorbidities [25, 28]. Excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion forms the ‘cytokine storm’, consequently led to the poor prognosis of COVID-19 [43]. Dysbiosis occurred through damaged epithelial layer induce ACE-2 receptors, therefore increase the virus replication. Hospitalized patients (46.7%) have virus remained dormant in the gut to help establish the fecal–oral route as well. Candida albicans, Candida auris, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger were noticeable fungi during all time point of hospitalization, while after fully recovery A. flavus and A. niger were detected in the fecal mycobiome [25, 28].

The older patients exhibited the decreased microbial diversity and heterogenous microbiota suggested age dependent dysbiosis and susceptibility to SARSCoV-2 infection. Indeed, pharyngeal heterogenous microflora influence the virus adherence, changed immune response, allowing pathogens/or commensals from gut to re-translocate systemically and to the other organs to exacerbate the respiratory illness [33, 34, 44, 45]. Hence, it is speculated that commensals and pathogenic microbes aggravate the COVID-19 under different conditions, depicted in Table 1.

# Immune Response Augmentation by Host Microbiome/and Virome

The most crucial character associated with COVID-19 is the different clinical outcomes; could be affected by genetics, life style and environment. Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with gut could trigger the deleterious biological pathways inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, as it enters the T-cells [11, 12, 18]. Pathogenic and protective effects are elicited due to MAMPs engaging with PRRs to regularize the innate and adaptive host immune response, along with subsequent pro/or anti-inflammatory response [46]. Commensal microbes
