More diverse microbiome and its microbial metabolites are important in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. However, dysbiosis may result in a loss of microbial functional pathways important in the production of bacterial metabolites, such as tryptophan [9], short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and other compounds with anti-inflammatory activities to regulate intestinal inflammation [1]. Specifically, IBD patients have lower levels of tryptophan and SCFAs in serum and fecal samples [9]. Further work is necessary to determine if these bacterial metabolites may serve as biomarkers for IBD, and if supplementation of these missing bacterial populations (as probiotics) and/or metabolites may be sufficient to serve as a potential IBD therapy.

Exploring gene–gut microbiome interactions may uncover novel strategies for early diagnosis and treatment of IBD. As probiotics and fecal microbiota transplant therapies become increasingly prevalent for IBD treatment, there is also a need to understand the mechanisms by which host immune pathways integrate microbiome-derived signals to promote intestinal homeostasis. Understanding whether individuals carrying risk alleles associated with IBD are receptive to the beneficial effects of microbial therapies will facilitate personalized approaches to treatment. The implications of the microbiome on precision medicine may be an important consideration for treatment of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases. In fact, recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome can predict patient responsiveness to immunomodulatory therapies, including both chemotherapies and an anti-integrin therapy (vedolizumab) used in IBD [11]. A personalized medicine approach that takes into consideration both host genetics and the gut microbiome could serve to predict therapeutic responses in the treatment of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases. Furthermore, future studies to identify novel pathways and their interactions with microbial communities could provide targets for more effective therapies and a better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD.
