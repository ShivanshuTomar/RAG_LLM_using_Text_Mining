standards, which included small molecules commonly found in the gut such as central carbon, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolites and bile acids were highly prevalent (detected in >90% metabo-lomes on an average) (Dataset EV1). Since physiologically relevant concentrations vary across metabolites, we observed a wide range of abundances spanning more than ten orders of magnitude (Fig. 1B). In contrast, prevalence was highly non-uniform for putative mass-match and unknown features, although many among the more prevalent features had comparable abundances to the standards (Fig. 1B; Dataset EV1).

For further analyses, we first filtered 14,634 redundant features likely to be potential adducts or fragments of metabolites (see “Methods”) and from the remaining 67,233 features, we considered the subset of prevalent features i.e., features that were observed in ≥70% metabolomes of at least one of the three phenotypes (diagnoses): CD, UC, and non-IBD. Of these 37,201 non-redundant, prevalent features which included 544 standards, 12,220 (~33%) were significantly disrupted during IBD (linear mixed-effects model, q value < 0.05, see “Methods”). The model includes both diagnosis (CD/UC/non-IBD) and disease activity (dysbiosis/nondysbiosis) as regressors. Comparisons between UC and non-IBD and CD-dysbiosis and CD-nondysbiosis yielded the most differentially abundant features: 8119 and 5400, respectively. In total, 200 of these were standards (Fig. 1C), including primary bile acids enriched and secondary bile acids and butyrate depleted in IBD, as expected (Dataset EV2) (Franzosa et al, 2019; Lloyd-Price et al, 2019). In addition, 10,941 putative matches and 1079 unknown features were significantly perturbed (either enriched or depleted). Taken together, the prevalence, abundance, and phenotype-associated perturbation of the 12,020 unannotated features pointed towards the richness of microbe-associated potential bioactives in the IBD gut metabolome.

Since this candidate pool was too large to simply test comprehensively, as is the case with many microbiome-associated phenotypes, we developed a new method that integrates diverse evidence to prioritize potentially bioactive metabolites from metabolomes. This approach transfers putative biological annotations to unannotated features based on “guilt-by-association”, i.e., the likelihood that related compounds will covary in abundance; quantitatively evaluates ecological and phenotype or environment-associated properties for each feature; and prioritizes features as potentially bioactive in a phenotype or condition of interest (Fig. 1D). The method, MACARRoN (Metabolome Analysis and Combined Annotation Ranks to pRioritize Novel bioactives), first clusters features into covarying abundance-based modules, optimizing the sensitivity and specificity with which unannotated features are associated with at least one standard (see “Methods”). For this, pairwise biweight midcorrelation (bicor) is used as the measure of correlation of abundances. Next, for each feature, abundance versus co-clustered anchor metabolite (AVA) and association with the phenotype (effect size and q value) are calculated (see “Methods”). These properties are used to determine the ecological and phenotypic/environmental relevance of each feature. MACARRoN combines ranks from each of these properties to prioritize metabolic features. As a result, features with abundances comparable or higher than the co-clustered anchor and significantly differentially abundant in the phenotype of interest are prioritized as potentially bioactive.

# Metabolite features with covarying abundances are functionally consistent and capture biochemical-relatedness

Covariance of a pair of metabolites is an indicator of functional relatedness such as co-occurrence in a biochemical pathway, co-synthesis by a microbe (or host), a common source such as diet, modification of a common parent compound, or abiotic fragmentation (Franzosa et al, 2019). To identify such associations as a means to extend annotations to the unannotated metabolic features in the HMP2 metabolomes, we used MACARRoN to cluster the 37,201 prevalent metabolic features into 355 modules based on covarying abundance (Dataset EV3). A very small number of features (1607; 4.3%) including 15 standards were not assigned to any module, referred to as singletons. Modules varied in size, ranging from 33 to 1116 features, and 67% (N = 241) of the modules had fewer than 100 features (Fig. 2A; Datasets EV3,and EV4). The 529 standards with module assignments were distributed across 124 (34.9%) modules (referred to as “annotated-modules” hereafter). The annotated-modules included 43% (N = 16,010) of all metabolic features, suggesting that nearly half of the prevalent but unidentified gut metabolites are partially characterizable based on covariance with a standard.

MACARRoN uses the co-membership of standards and unannotated metabolic features in a module to assign initial annotations (such as the chemical classes of covarying standards) to unannotated features, as well as determine their ecological relevance for prioritization. To ensure the legitimacy of assigned annotations, it is important that a module contains a biologically consistent set of metabolites. We therefore performed multiple evaluations to optimize the co-occurrence parameters and establish the biological validity of these modules. A previous study of stool metabolomes found that covarying metabolites are 15× more likely to belong to the same chemical class compared to random metabolite pairs (Franzosa et al, 2019). To compare our results with this observation, we estimated the “chemical homogeneity” of annotated-modules using information about the chemical class of the standards in the modules. The chemical homogeneity of a module was calculated as the ratio of the frequency of the most common chemical class to the number of standards in the module (see “Methods”). Chemical class information was available for standards in 110 annotated-modules, of which 57 contained two or more standards. Modules that are reasonably chemically homogeneous are ideal, as they are most likely to be analogs of biochemical pathways.

Remarkably, 26 (~46%) of annotated-modules containing 2–16 standards were ≥75% homogeneous, and an additional 9 were observed to be ≥ 60% homogeneous (Fig. 2B; Dataset EV4). Further, across all modules, standards representing the same HMDB ID were assigned to the same module in 83.33% of cases. This clustering strategy remained successful when further applied to an additional stool metabolomics dataset (Franzosa et al, 2019)—45% modules with ≥2 standards were ≥75% homogeneous and a further 7 (9.4%) were ≥60% homogeneous (Dataset EV5). Lastly, we sought to identify features representing 8 pentacyclic triterpene compounds, namely, 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, alphitolic acid, asiatic acid, gypsogenin, hederagenin, rotundic acid, sumaresinolic acid, and tormentic acid (that were included as standards in another metabolomics study) in the HMP2.
