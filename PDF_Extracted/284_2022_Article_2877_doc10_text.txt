# Regulation the immune response by diversified gut microbiota

(IFNLR1)/IL10R2 along with IL-22 production by innate lymphoid ILC3 cells effectively control the rotavirus infection. IFN-λ also regulates the viral replication. IFNs also promote the adaptive immune response including CD8 + T-cell responses in controlling the murine norovirus. However, the rotavirus vaccination correlates with IgA antibodies production [80, 81].

In mammals, the cGAS & STING pathway is critical in sensing the intracellular DNA; to produce the immune signals against DNA viruses. The cGAS binds to the cytosolic DNA, and 2′, 3′-cGAMP to produce CDN, a second messenger to activate STING. The activated STING uses its C-terminal tail (CTT) to appoint serine/threonine kinase (TBK1), which phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor IRF3 to induce the expression of IFNs. IFNs go through the JAK-STAT pathways to stimulate the transcription of many antiviral genes (ISGs). STING has the capability to induce other pathways, to activate NFkB, MAP kinase, STAT6, autophagy, senescence and apoptosis [82]. The detailed process on these immune signaling is yet to be understood.

# Endosomal and cytosolic innate immune surveillance regulated by enteroviruses and bacteriophages

The viral DNA and RNA are signaled via TLRs or PRRs. The endosomal TLR signals are processed through MyD88 and TRIF. The cytosolic RIG-1 and MDA5 signals through MAVS to stimulate the expression of IFN I and IFN III, which attach through IFNAR 1&2 (IFN α, IFN β) and IL10R2 (IFNλ) receptors to induce antiviral response. The intracellular DNA is sensed via cGAS-STING pathway, producing 2′, 3′-cGAMP to activate STING stimulating the expression of IFNs through NFkB.
