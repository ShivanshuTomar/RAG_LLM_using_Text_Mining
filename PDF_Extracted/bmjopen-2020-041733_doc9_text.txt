We will enhance this approach by convening citizen panels to capture the insights and values of a diverse group of citizens, with different types of lived experience with the issue at hand, in a panel summary, the key messages of which would be included in the evidence brief informing the stakeholder dialogue. We plan to address two topics using this approach, one focused on reducing emergency-department usage in people with IBD, and one focused on framing the work led by IMAGINE in the context of rapid learning health systems for specific conditions (including those addressed by the IMAGINE Network). For each topic we will conduct consultations with a steering committee and key informants to define the terms of reference for evidence briefs, identify stakeholders and potential dialogue invitees, and review the outputs (briefs, summaries and evaluation reports).

# ARTICLE SUMMARY

# Strengths

Studies that have evaluated the microbiome in IBS18 and IBD19 have been small and underpowered. These studies usually did not evaluate disease phenotype in detail and have not assessed diet,18 19 which can be an important effect modifier.58 This will be the largest observational study published to date that is sufficiently powered to evaluate the microbiome in IBS and IBD. All relevant confounding factors and effect modifiers will be captured and followed over time and longitudinally, which will allow a better understanding of what drives exacerbations of both IBS and IBD given that these are chronic relapsing and remitting diseases. There is also the possibility of pooling data with similar cohorts to provide more robust data on microbiome changes over time in these diseases.59 The other strength of the study is the multidisciplinary team that makes up the IMAGINE Network. In particular, the collaboration between psychiatry and gastroenterology allows a careful evaluation of gut brain connections17 and in particular how the gut microbiome60 may impact on anxiety and depression in patients with IBD and IBS. Another key component of the multidisciplinary team is the level of patient engagement throughout the proposal. This is a Canadian Institute of Health Research funded grant through the SPOR initiative mandating that priorities are set by patients and they have input into study design. To date, we have 19 patient partners as part of the IMAGINE Network and many are involved in the MAGIC cohort study. This strengthens the research, making it more patient focused, and supports knowledge translation of the findings to patients.

# Limitations

This study is observational so any associations found may not relate to the causes of IBS and IBD. We will rigorously control for confounding factors and but cannot control for unknown confounders and so cannot draw causal inferences from the data. The MAGIC study will therefore be hypothesis generating and any data relating to the microbiome or diet are likely to need confirmation in RCTs. The IMAGINE Network is committed to develop RCTs to further investigate any promising findings from the MAGIC cohort study. This is the largest study evaluating IBS and IBD, but the data that will be collected are enormous and so any results related to the secondary outcomes of the study need to be interpreted with caution. The adjustment for multiple testing is for the primary outcomes only and given the number of other outcomes that can be evaluated with the data that are generated, it is important to realise that any positive results from the secondary outcomes could be a chance finding related to multiple testing. We will highlight this when reporting the data of more exploratory outcomes being studied. Despite these caveats, the MAGIC Study will provide valuable insight into the aetiology of IBS and IBD as well as associated psychiatric disorders. Data from this study will also provide strategies for personalised medicine approaches to manage these diseases more effectively.
