# Role of interleukin-6-mediated inflammation in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease

# IL-6 and the gut microbiome

Mucosal immune cells are responsible for the release of IL-6. This cytokine could induce inflammatory responses, gastric homeostasis, and post-damage regeneration of the intestine. Studies also suggested an association between the content of the gut microbiome, dysbiosis, and the expression of IL-6 (Wu et al. 2022). A study on IL-6 gene knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 J mice demonstrated that gut microbiome diversity was considerably changed in IL-6 KO compared with the WT. It was observed that the frequency of Verrucomicrobia and Akkermansia increased while the number of Firmicutes and Lactobacillus species decreased in the IL-6 KO group.

Moreover, in the absence of IL-6, intestinal expression of defensins α3 and α4, as well as the frequency of natural isolated TCRγδ+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), was remarkably increased, inducing mucosal immune responses. Consequently, it is possible that the absence of IL-6 remodels gut microbiome structure and changes the maintenance of IELs (Wu et al. 2022). As a pleiotropic cytokine, IL-6 is elevated in IBD. In parallel with these findings, a study on Il6 −/− mice with UC showed that IL-6 deficiency leads to colitis development. Furthermore, IL-6 deficiency pointedly amplified the colon tissue expression of Ccl2/Ccr2, increasing the recruitment of Ly6C high monocytes, Il6 −/− macrophages, and neutrophils to the inflamed colon of the studied mice (Cao et al. 2021).

It has been reported that the intestine's various populations of Escherichia coli increased during DSS-mediated inflammation and induced strain-specific disease phenotypes and immunopathological alterations. Following treatment with DSS, the levels of the inflammatory mediators, including IFN-γ, IL-6, and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), were increased, which is considered a characteristic of the severe inflammation induced by ST129 and ST375 strains of E. coli.

Interestingly, data mining and in vivo neutralization revealed that IL-6 plays an important role in causing inflammatory responses in different phases of the disease. This is despite the fact that colonization of DDS-treated mice with ST150 and ST468 E. coli strains led to a negligible increase in inflammatory responses (Kittana et al. 2018). It has been reported that the gut microbiota induced the differentiation of regulatory B cells (Breg cells) in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen. As mentioned, IL-6 is involved in gut homeostasis. A study reported that IL-6 could reduce excessive inflammation caused by microbiome alteration by inducing differentiation and expansion of Bregs (Rosser et al. 2014).

In patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria such as Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus species in the gut and the elevated plasma levels of IL-6 could be associated with insulin resistance and mild inflammation. Therefore, gut microbiota signature might accompany T2D development (Leite et al. 2017).

Collectively, IL-6 may have a dual role depending on the gut microbiota pattern. With the increase of bacterial pathogen species and the disturbance of the microbiome balance, increased inflammatory responses can be seen that IL-6 is involved in these destructive responses. On the other hand, when the normal intestinal flora and beneficial bacterial species are sufficiently present in the intestine, IL-6 is more involved in homeostasis and the reduction of pathologic inflammation.

# Targeting the IL-6/IL-6R axis in inflammatory bowel diseases

According to the reviewed studies, local release of a wide range of non-specific inflammatory mediators, including leukotrienes, free radicals, cytokines, and chemokines, could cause IBD development. The production and secretion of the mentioned cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, IL-23, TGF-β, and CCL2 could lead to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the intestinal tissue (Monteleone et al. 2006). Therefore, targeting these pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines or their receptors via various inhibitors could effectively treat IBD (Guan 2019).

For instance, using mAbs against IL-12/23 p40 in morin models of colitis could reduce disease severity (Becker et al. 2006; Yen et al. 2006). Moreover, in DSS-induced colitis mice treated with anti-IL-21 antibody, colonic T cells' infiltration and release of IL-6 and IL-17A were significantly decreased in inflamed intestinal tissue (Stolfi et al. 2011). A major challenge in treating IBD via IL-6 targeting is the dual role of this cytokine in the pathogenesis of IBD. IL-6 can participate in both IBD progression and mucosal repair (Choi et al. 2015).
