# REVIEW SERIES: INTERACTIONS OF THE MICROBIOTA WITH THE MUCOSAL IMMUNE SYSTEM

# Immune mechanisms of FMT in UC

induced colitis [57–59]. Interestingly, and perhaps paradoxically, multiple reports have demonstrated that Tregs represent a greater fraction of the lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) in the intestines of IBD patients compared to healthy controls [60,61]. Tregs are even more common in actively inflamed than non-inflamed mucosa. Moreover, IBD patients with high proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to demonstrate an increased prevalence of dual lineage with IL-17-secreting FoxP3-expressing CD4+ T cell subsets in the circulation and tissue [62,63]. Whether these Tregs have inherent functional deficits in immunoregulatory activity or are Tregs demonstrating Th17 plasticity is yet to be determined [64,65].

Mechanisms by which microbial stimuli result in Treg–Th17 conversion via TLR-2 signalling have been highlighted [66]. Certainly, the importance of microbiota in influencing Treg-mediated intestinal homeostasis has been described in several key studies. Transfer of specific Clostridia strains derived from human stool into GF mice induced a three-fold increase in Tregs [67]. This Treg increase was significantly higher with the transfer of 30 strains compared to a single strain highlighting the role of microbial diversity in host immune responses in IBD [68]. These strains were able to induce important anti-inflammatory molecules, including IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS), in addition to the production of immunoregulatory short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Species from these SCFA-producing Clostridiales species have been shown to be reduced in the gut microbiota in patients with IBD, supporting the gut microbiota-mediated Treg functionality hypothesis [69].

A recent pivotal study demonstrated that transfer of microbiota from IBD patients into GF mice significantly increased numbers of intestinal Th17 cells and decreased numbers of RORγt + Treg cells compared to microbiota from healthy individuals [70]. Furthermore, colonization with microbiota derived from IBD patients exacerbated colitis in a T cell transfer Rag1−/− mouse model, and the disease status correlated with an increase in microbiota-induced proportions of Th17 and RORγt + Treg cells compared to mice colonized with healthy donor microbiotas. These findings collectively highlight the role of microbiota in determining intestinal Th17 and RORγt + Treg cell compartments as an important mechanism of pathogenesis in IBD.

A variety of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms are known to influence immunoglobulin responses to the intestinal microbiota [71,72]. Increased infiltration of intestinal mucosal plasma cells and mucosal immunoglobulin levels provide further compelling evidence for gut mucosal–microbial interaction in the pathogenesis of IBD. High levels of mucosal IgG directed against commensal bacterial antigens have been described in the gut in IBD and these appear to be principally directed against the bacterial cytoplasmic rather than the membrane proteins [73,74]. Patients with UC appear to have higher serum IgG responses to species including Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains, E. faecalis, Streptococcus bovis and specific bacteria from the Clostridia class, and these antibodies greatly enhanced the respiratory burst in polymorphonuclear neutrophils in response to bacterial species [75].

A key study that performed 16S rRNA sequencing of IgA-coated intestinal microbiota (IgA-seq) isolated from stool in IBD patients discovered that 35 species were uniquely highly coated in patients with IBD, and this was often independent of differences in abundances [76]. These IgA-inducing members of the intestinal microbiota cultured from IBD patients exacerbated dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) colitis in GF mice, thereby highlighting its causal role in susceptibility to colitis.

# Exploring gut microbiota manipulation for treatment of IBD

As no single causative trigger has been yet identified, similar to most immune-mediated diseases, treatment of IBD is primarily directed towards suppression of host immunological consequences. Current treatments for IBD are focused on counteracting multiple facets of these immune pathways. Drugs blocking pleiotropic proinflammatory pathways, such as steroids, immunomodulatory drugs, anti-TNF agents, the Th1/Th17 axis via IL-12/23 blockage and leucocyte trafficking via anti-integrins and signalling molecules, are the mainstay of medical management of IBD [77]. These agents are fairly effective, with steroid-free clinical remission rates ranging from 57% for combination therapy with infliximab (anti-TNF) and azathioprine (thiopurine) to 18% for tofactinib [targets Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway] [78]. With increasing evidence of a dysregulated intestinal microbiome being a probable immunological trigger for inflammation in IBD, exploring therapeutic manipulation of the gut microbiome is an attractive strategy to identify new treatment options, and help understand the underlying cause of IBD.

Microbial manipulation in IBD has been evaluated through several approaches. A fairly untargeted approach using antibiotics has only proved successful in treating inflammation that occurs in the distal small bowel that has been refashioned into a pouch following removal of the large bowel for colitis – known as pouchitis [79]. There is limited evidence for the role of antibiotics in mild to moderate CD, with questionable long-term benefits [80]. Certainly, antibiotic-related adverse events, unknown long-term consequences associated with alterations in the microbiome and the emergence of anti-microbial resistant genes makes this strategy of limited attractiveness. Targeted modulation of gut microbiota has been explored with the use of probiotics. These are live microorganisms that
