We noted 29 ongoing studies that reflect the scientific community's interest in investigating the role of FMT for treatment of IBD (see Characteristics of ongoing studies table). However, we anticipate challenges with adoption and conduct of this intervention as a 'drug' in clinical practice due to variation in production and quality control of each FMT specimen. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued guidelines to help with appropriate development of FMT-based products used in clinical studies, and the guidance includes information on donor screening and blood testing, stool testing, as well as appropriate preparation and administration of the FMT product (Carlson 2020). The FDA also emphasized the need to develop potency assays of the FMT product and perform stability studies to ensure that individual species within the product's microbiota are viable and to assess any potential impact of the donor microbiome on the product's safety and effectiveness (Carlson 2020). There is also growing interest in other microbiome-based therapies, such as modified stool products that may reduce the concentration of potentially harmful bacteria (Feuerstadt 2022), and the administration of laboratory-grown bacteria without using any stool product (Rode 2021) for treatment of rCDI. Future studies may focus on some of these newer microbiome-based therapies to investigate their role in the treatment of IBD.
