This complex interplay between genetics, the microbiota, the immune system and the environment makes it particularly hard to understand this class of diseases. Offered a complete historical review of the IBD until the 1980s, by quoting Hippocrates, who described diarrhoea as a symptom of an infectious (or non-infectious) disease to a description of the hypothetical pathogenesis of IBD, which the microbiota was not considered, though. A more recent projection predicted the evolution of the disease between 2015 and 2025 and updated the possible origins of IBD, including the action of antibiotics on the gut microbiota in Western society. Xavier et al. summarized the findings of the origins of IBD, mentioning the complexity of the disease. Another historical review focuses on the genetics of the IBD identified NOD2 as the first CD susceptible gene and then described the evolution of the IBD genetics with the coming of the modern genome-wide association study. One of the first and most comprehensive works describing the interaction of all the aforementioned factors can be found in Ref. The systems biology approach to the study of IBD was presented by Fiocchi et al., which proposed the creation of an IBD interactome, a complex system connecting all the potential agents interacting among them that derived from the combination of different omics.

Our work starts from here and attempts to provide tools and methods from network science useful to build and study the IBD interactome with a systems biology approach by commencing from the metagenomic data of the gut microbiome. This approach is typical of network medicine, a novel discipline that mixes network science with systems biology to tackle the challenges offered by the progress of personalized medicine, which opposes the current effective yet drastic procedures like the FMT. Network science is the discipline used to analyse complex systems. It could be suited to understand a complex disease like IBD in which a complex system like the gut microbiota plays a fundamental role. Complexity in the intestinal microbial communities arises at different scales; from the macroscopic point of view, we have the ecological interactions that describe the relationships among the species in the gut microbiota; among these, we have three different main types of interactions: positive interactions (cooperation, commensalism, cross-feeding), negative interactions (competition, ammensalism), and asymmetric interactions (exploitation, predation, parasitism). Going towards a microscopic scale, we can find the gene networks, often represented by gene co-expression networks and metabolic networks built by connecting the substances, known as metabolites, reacting in the same metabolic processes.

The application of network science for the study of the complexity of the gut microbiome is recent, and one of the first research was in the case of C. difficile infection. The microbiome in this work was represented as a boolean network derived from binarized temporal data of the abundance of specific bacteria species in the gut. Although the study captured the dynamics of the bacterial species, e.g., negative, positive or neutral interaction, it did not take into account the genetic expression of the microbiome (metagenome), which could better explain the complex interplay between the bacterial species. Our study, by contrast, gives a static screenshot of the microbial interactions through metagenomics. A more recent study analysed the co-abundance network built with SparCC; the need for this tool is due to the necessity of sparsifying the network that would have too many correlated nodes because of normalization and a p-value threshold too high. Based on a topological property of the biological networks, the work by Vernocchi et al. portrays a weighted gene co-expression network analysis by building a network from metagenomic data and removing the weaker edges based on the assumption that the final network would be scale-free. In our work, we used thresholding methods that rely on the network topology, such as the percolation threshold or the p-value for the projected edges, similar to the later research. These methods should overcome the aforementioned problems. Furthermore, the emergence of specific network properties (community detection, betweenness centrality) can be used as possible IBD biomarkers. In a complex system, such as the gut microbiota, it is hard to observe changes in single biomarkers. Diseases emerge from malfunctioning in the collective behaviour of the nodes. Therefore, community detection and betweenness centralities are important properties to be analysed. The former describes how the pathways are grouped in the complex system and the latter represents the pillar pathways among all the interactions that sustain the collective functioning of the network.

# Results

In the next paragraphs, each pathway is called with a code name composed of the pathway code and the related species (e.g., “PATHWAYCODE|SPECIES”) for the sake of brevity and clarity, it is possible to consult the table mapping the correspondences between the codes and the complete pathway (Table S1 of Supplementary Material). The properties of the main pathways can be found in the same table, the BioCyc and the MetaCyc collections. The small set of reads that are mapped to proteins and are not associated with pangenomics are labelled as “unclassified”.

The correlation networks for each diagnosis were obtained by isolating the samples of each diagnosis and then calculating the Pearson correlation of the samples to obtain a weighted network that was made binary through a percolation threshold of each diagnosis network (thDIAGNOSIS). Each correlation network was built by collecting the pathways from subjects diagnosed with Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) or healthy non-IBD (NI). The pathways were divided into prevalent (if present in more than 75% of the samples), common (if present in 50% to 75% of the samples) and uncommon (if present in 25% to 50% of the samples). We refer to the Methods section for a more detailed description of the methods. In the prevalent pathways, the number of edges in the NI correlation network was 3356 (thNI = 0.453), in CD correlation network was 2905 (thCD = 0.357), and in the UC correlation network was 3160 (thUC = 0.364). The results showed that the NI metagenome was more connected for prevalent pathways and the percolation threshold was higher compared to the percolation thresholds in the CD and the UC correlation networks, translating into more strongly correlated nodes in the NI correlation network.
