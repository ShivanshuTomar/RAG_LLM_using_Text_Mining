# Background

Contrary to the classical phenotype of low body weight and malnourishment from earlier times, many patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are now overweight or obese [1]. This increases the risk of metabolic disorders such as type two diabetes mellitus and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [2]. While some patients with IBD experience cachexia, particularly those with advanced Crohn’s disease, modern lifestyles typified by sedentary living and high-caloric food availability, are contributing to the increase in obesity and obesity-related conditions in patients with IBD.

Optimal control of inflammatory activity remains a primary objective in the treatment of IBD and is an area in which considerable advances have taken place in the past decade. However, attention to details such as the consequences of physical activity through exercise has received less attention. Known for its anti-inflammatory and multi-organ metabolic effects [3, 4], exercise represents first line treatment for patients with type two diabetes mellitus and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [5, 6]. Potential benefits of exercise for patients with IBD extend beyond metabolic enhancement and include improvements in quality of life, fatigue levels and bone mineral density. However, improvement in body composition through muscle mass accretion remains an underexplored area that could exert a particularly advantageous effect of exercise in patients with IBD.

Habitual levels of physical activity in patients with IBD are significantly lower than in matched controls [7]. When combined with nutrient malabsorption and corticosteroid treatment, this leads to a higher prevalence of sarcopenia in IBD sufferers. Despite improvements in pharmacological treatments, sarcopenia prevalence in IBD populations remains high (up to 60% in Crohn’s Disease) [8], irrespective of BMI [9], and predicts future need for surgical treatment in both underweight [10] and overweight/obese cohorts [9].

Notwithstanding the likely benefits of exercise in IBD, there is a paucity of focussed prospective studies [11]. No trials have examined the efficacy or safety of combined aerobic and resistance (strength) training in improving body composition and increasing muscle mass in patients with IBD. Therefore we addressed this issue in a randomized, controlled cross-over trial to determine if a combined aerobic and resistance exercise program could safely and quickly achieve desirable body compositional changes in patients with IBD.

# Methods

# Study design and conduct

We performed a single-centre, randomized, partial cross-over trial recruiting between March and December 2015 (Fig. 1). The trial was registered at https://clinical-Trials.gov (Trial number: NCT02463916) and conforms to CONSORT guidelines for randomized controlled trials. Prior to trial commencement, ethical approval was granted by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals. All volunteers gave written informed consent. The clinical notes of age-suitable patients attending a dedicated Inflammatory Bowel Disease outpatient clinic at Cork University Hospital, Cork City, Ireland, were reviewed by the study investigators for exclusion criteria. If no reason for exclusion was apparent, consecutive patients were invited to participate at the clinic, by letter or by telephone. Patients were invited to participate according to a strict, eligibility-based criteria as outlined below.

Eligible patients were randomized (1:1) by simple methods (drawing of group numbers from a concealed container) to one of two groups: Exercise or Control. Randomization was overseen by two study investigators. Due to the nature of the intervention, a combined exercise program, it was not possible to conceal group allocation to the participants or investigators. Patients randomized to the exercise group underwent measurement and sampling eight weeks apart (start and end of the intervention period). During this intervention period, participants in the exercise group undertook a combined aerobic and resistance exercise program. Patients randomized to the non-exercising control group initially underwent a controlled-phase where usual levels of physical inactivity were maintained for eight weeks. Participants were measured for primary and secondary outcomes at the start and end of this period. Following completion of the control phase, participants then ‘crossed over’ to the intervention arm of the study, where they undertook the same exercise program for eight weeks (Fig. 1). Volunteers were again measured at the end of the eight-week intervention period.

# Participants

Male and female patients, aged 18 to 40 years were recruited from a dedicated IBD clinic. All patients, including those assigned to the control arm of the study, were required to have a diagnosis of IBD. Eligible patients were required to be physically inactive or have low levels of activity (as defined by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire) [12] with no involvement in regular or organised exercise in the month prior to recruitment. Furthermore, only patients in disease remission and with a BMI of 22 to 35 kg/m2 were eligible. Any patients having experienced a disease flare or having received treatment with corticosteroids in the two weeks prior to invitation were excluded. Volunteers who had received oral antibiotics, bowel preparation, or had suffered an infectious gastrointestinal illness in the last month were...
