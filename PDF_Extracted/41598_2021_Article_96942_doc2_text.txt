# Changes in microbiome diversity and composition across patients with IBD

We first wanted to establish how gut microbiome diversity and composition changed across patients with CD, UC, and MC. Notably, few studies have previously looked at MC.

# Patient and public involvement

Patients were involved in the design and dissemination of FAMISHED study where elements of the study were presented to the patient research advisory group. Specifically, dissemination in both scientific and lay literature were encouraged. The latter was undertaken via newsletters overseen by Research & Development Office.

# DNA extractions and sequencing

Protocol using the Qiagen PowerSoil Kit. PCR amplicons were generated using Platinum Taq polymerase (Inv-DNA was extracted from stool according to the Earth Microbiome nitrogen) for the V4 16S region 515F(Parada)/806R(Apprill) and sequenced using a NextSeq 550 High Output v2.5 kit producing > 100,000 paired-end reads per sample.

# Bioinformatics

Sequenced data was analysed through the QIIME2 (version 2019.7) with Deblur used for sequence quality control using the same settings as previously described by the UK National Institute for Biological Standards and Control. Following removal of primers and adapters with q2-cutadapt plugin, paired ends were joined using the q2-vsearch plugin. Sequences were quality controlled using the q2-quality-filter plugin followed by the q2-deblur plugin. The q2-feature-classifier (sklearn) was used to assign taxonomy to representative sequences against the Silva database (132 release, https://www.arb-silva.de/ [last accessed 02/10/2019]). Sequences were further filtered using the q2-feature-table plugin to ensure all features which were less than 0.005% abundant for each replicate were removed. The q2-diversity plugin was used to generate rarefaction curves, which indicated saturation at approximately 30,000 sequences. Conservatively, we rarefied all samples to 50,000 sequences and exported the Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) final feature table for statistical analysis in R version 3.60. The q2-diversity plugin was also used to calculate the Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity Measure for all rarefied samples. We used the tool PICRUSt2 to predict metagenomic functions from the 16S rRNA sequencing data.

# Statistical analysis

All statistical analysis was performed using R (version 3.60). The Faiths Phylogenetic Diversity Measure and Observed Number of ASVs were used as measures of alpha diversity across the samples and were calculated using the q2-diversity plugin. A Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test was performed to compare the mean average of each diversity measure between IBD patients and healthy controls. A Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance was conducted to compare diversity measures across IBD conditions, with a Dunn test conducted using the ‘dunn.test’ package to perform pairwise comparison as a post-hoc test following the Kruskal–Wallis test with p values corrected for false discovery using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. For each IBD condition, diversity measures were compared across disease location using a Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance with the Dunn test used to perform a pairwise-comparisons with p values corrected for false discovery using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. This same method was applied to compare diversity measures for different levels of disease severity across IBD conditions. Metadata and the Final Feature table were imported into Phyloseq for beta-diversity analysis. A Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix was constructed and visualized following a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Comparison of community composition between IBD conditions was conducted using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) through the package ‘vegan’ using the function ‘adonis’. A pairwise PERMANOVA was used to compare each IBD condition using the package ‘RVAideMemoire’ with the function ‘pairwise.perm.manova’ with p values corrected for false discovery using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. This method was repeated to compare community composition across disease locations for each IBD disease. The tool LEfSe was used to determine which taxa were enriched for each IBD condition and IBD location. Data on Metacyc pathway abundance for each sample as measured using PICRUSt2 was also analysed using R and LEfSe. Metadata and a table of pathway abundances were imported into Phyloseq for beta-diversity analysis. A Bray–Curtis dissimilarity matrix was constructed and visualized following a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Comparison of community composition between IBD conditions was conducted using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) through the package ‘vegan’ using the function ‘adonis’. A pairwise PERMANOVA was used to compare each IBD condition using the package ‘RVAideMemoire’ with the function ‘pairwise.perm.manova’ with p values corrected for false discovery using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.
