|A|AUC|
|---|---|
|a: Bifidobacterium| |
|b: Bifidobacteriaceae| |
|c: Bifidobacteriales| |
|d: Collinsella| |
|e: Coriobacteriaceae| |
|f: Coriobacteriales| |
|g: Rikenellaceae| |
|h: Blautia| |
|i: Veillonella| |
|j: Eubacterium_hallii_group| |
|k: Acinetobacter| |
|l: Dorea| |
|m: Lachnospiraceae| |
|n: Moraxellaceae| |
|o: Pseudomonadales| |

taxa were observed when accounting for disease severity of UC or CD, though this could be due to a low sample numbers of moderate and severe disease.
