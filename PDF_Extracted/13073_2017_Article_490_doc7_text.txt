# Fig. 3 R. gnavus metagenomic strain phylogeny

A phylogenetic tree of R. gnavus strains, calculated from SNP profiles of R. gnavus marker genes (see “Methods”), where each tree leaf is a sample from the LSS or Lewis et al. cohorts (subject plus time point). Subject SKST012 is the only included control individual, as no other control metagenomes contained enough R. gnavus reads for detection and strain assignment by StrainPhlAn. Bootstrap values are indicated on branches and reveal two distinct clades of R. gnavus strains with different functional potential.

To perform this analysis, we used the PanPhlAn tool [6]. Because its pre-computed pangenome database for R. gnavus lacked sufficient representatives from clade 2, we increased our pangenome coverage for clade 2 strains by sequencing and assembling genomes of 11 additional isolates of R. gnavus from IBD patients and infants (in addition to the currently existing six reference genomes; Additional file 5: Table S5). The new R. gnavus pangenome contained 11,933 genes with an average of 3117 genes per genome. Only 1178 genes were found in all 17 R. gnavus genomes, indicating that 74% of the R. gnavus genome is variable between strains. The size of the variable genome ranges from 1708 to 2473 genes.

The pangenome analysis on the 17 R. gnavus reference genomes confirmed the presence of two distinct clades as identified by their SNP profiles (Additional file 6: Figure S1). Two previously reported R. gnavus reference genomes were present in clade 2, but neither were from healthy adults (Additional file 5: Table S5). Using all metagenomic samples from the LSS, Lewis et al., and HMP cohorts, we found that R. gnavus strains from all controls and some IBD patients belonged to clade 1. On the other hand, only R. gnavus strains from IBD patients belonged to clade 2. Importantly, strains from clade 2 were present in patients originating from three different clinical centers in the US, suggesting the generality of this observation. The functional characterization of both.
