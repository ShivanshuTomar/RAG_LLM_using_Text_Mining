# Introduction

Gut microbial imbalance is noted in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) [1–3]. However, studies spanning different countries failed to report consistent unified microbial alterations [4], and while altered microbiome likely plays a role in IBD pathogenesis, the precise microbial dysfunction is not entirely understood. In parallel, many other disease-control studies, most of which are not linked with chronic gut inflammation, have shown alteration in the gut microbial composition. Those various microbial shifts across diseases emphasize the lack of systematic understanding regarding the role of the gut microbiota in healthy and disease states, and its link with the overt gut inflammation seen in IBD. Specifically, we still lack a comprehensive understanding whether different diseases like IBD are characterized by distinct microbial shifts that may be therapeutically targeted or rather by a non-specific general “sick-microbial” state [5].

We re-analyzed raw data from publicly available V4 16S amplicon sequences using a unified pipeline (28 diseases, 59 disease cohorts, and 12,838 subjects). We defined 731 bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that were associated with a disease state in at least one disease cohort, and by examining the behavior of these ASVs across all disease cohorts, we identified a robust nonspecific microbial response shared by many diseases. Random forest disease-classifiers trained on one disease cohort (i.e., IBD) also predicted relatively well the disease state in other cohorts with different diseases, likely due to this shared microbial pattern, and we used it to define a novel universal dysbiosis index (UniDI) that successfully differentiates between most cases and controls across diseases. Finally, we identified a set of UC/CD-specific taxa that show a pronounced change in UC/CD compared to other diseases. Those can be prioritized for laboratory exploration to study their potential role in eliciting the intestinal inflammation seen in IBD and can direct future IBD-specific interventions.

# Results

# Uniform case‑control analytic pipeline

We identified 59 case-control studies that used V4 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing spanning 28 diseases and 12,838 subjects from different geographical regions including North America, Europe, Middle East, and Asia (Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S1). Raw reads from all samples were trimmed and denoised using Deblur. We included two large studies with multiple diseases: the UK Twins and the American Gut Project (AGP) cohorts. In those and other studies where several diseases were investigated, samples were split to specific disease cohorts, with controls randomly divided between the different disease cohorts and using only one sample per patient. Since all cohorts used the same V4 16S rRNA region, we were able to process, combine, and analyze all cohorts together at the ASV sequence level, thus leading to an enhanced phylogenetic resolution compared to taxonomy-based comparisons, which are usually limited to the genus level for 16S amplicon sequencing. Study-specific variation was a major confounder (Additional file 1: Fig. S1A), likely due to sample collection, processing methods [36], and differences in the populations studied. This was further supported by measuring distances (beta-diversity) between sample-groups within and between studies (Additional file 1: Fig. S1B), showing significantly higher distances between studies.
