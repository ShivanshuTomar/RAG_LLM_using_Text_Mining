# Measurements and efficacy criteria

The primary outcome was change in participant body composition as determined by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). A GE Healthcare Lunar iDXA machine (Madison, Wisconsin, USA) at the Bone Densitometry Unit, Cork University Hospital was used. The enCORE software (V.13.4, 2010) analysed body composition using a three-compartment model (fat mass, bone mass, lean tissue). Total fat mass, truncal fat mass, total lean tissue mass and percentage body fat were recorded. Scanning was performed with the volunteers dressed in light clothing with removal of metal-wear and after they had voided urine. To reduce potential interference with true body composition assessment and the effects of diurnal variation, patients were measured between 7 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. and were asked to refrain from alcohol and moderate to vigorous physical activity for at least 24 h prior to measurement. Quality control analysis was performed daily on the iDXA machine.

Secondary outcomes included changes in disease activity scores, quality of life measures, anxiety and depression indices, serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and change in the α- and β- diversity of the gut microbiome. For patients with Crohn’s Disease the Harvey Bradshaw Index was used to assess disease at the start and end of the exercise and control periods [16]. For patients with Ulcerative Colitis, the Simple Colitis Index was used [17]. Patients were instructed to report any deterioration in gastrointestinal symptoms to the study team and any symptoms suggestive of a disease flare meant removal of the patient from the study. Quality of life was assessed using the Short Form 36 health survey (SF36®V2) [18] at the start and end of the study periods. Similarly, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [19], State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [20], and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) [21] were used to assess changes in mood score and psychological well-being.

To assess improvements in physical fitness following the intervention, all exercising patients underwent cardiorespiratory fitness testing before and after the exercise program. To avoid harm from unaccustomed vigorous exercise, we used a validated, submaximal assessment of peak aerobic capacity to estimate maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) [22]. The Rockport one-mile walk test was performed at the indoor running track of the Mardyke Arena, Cork. This testing took place in a standardized temperature environment.

# Pro-inflammatory cytokine measurement

All study participants underwent phlebotomy in the resting state before and after the exercise and control periods. Approximately 2mls of supernatant sera were harvested by pipette, frozen and stored at − 80 °C in polypropylene cryogenic vials. Following collection of all serum samples, resting pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured using an electrochemiluminesence-based solid-phase multiplex assay (MSD; Meso Scale Discovery platform, Rockville, Maryland, USA). Serum concentrations of interleukins 6, 8, and 10; and Tumour Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) were measured. The lower limit of detection for the assays was less than 1 pg/ml and standardized calibration curves were constructed for each plate. Samples were measured in duplicate and the mean cytokine concentration (pg/ml) of the duplicates was used for the subsequent statistical analysis.

# DNA extraction and metagenomic sequencing of faecal microbiome

Patients’ stool samples were collected into a sealed, secure container and transported to the Teagasc Moorepark research facility for DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from fresh faecal material before freezing and within 6 h of defecation in the vast majority of cases and never after 12 h. Extraction was performed using a QIAmp DNA stool minikit (Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, United Kingdom). Faecal sample preparation prior to DNA extraction and DNA library preparation was identical to methods previously described by the authors [15]. An equimolar library pool of all samples was made prior to sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq 500 (chemistry V.2.0) sequencing platform (Teagasc sequencing facility). High-throughput sequencing was performed using the high-output 500/550 reagent kit.

# Bioinformatic processing of microbial metagenomic sequencing

Quality control of metagenomic FASTQ sequences proceeded with the removal of host (human) reads using NCBI Best Match Tagger (BMTagger version 1.1.0). Reads were converted to Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format and sorted using FastqToSam (version 2.7.1). Low-quality reads (Phred quality score < 20), adapter sequences and short reads (Length cutoff: 105 bp) were trimmed using trimBWAstyle.usingBam.pl script. PCR duplicates were removed using MarkDuplicates from Picard tools version 2.7.1. Finally, forward and reverse reads were merged and converted to FASTA format using IDBA fq2fa version 1.1.1. The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) Unified Metabolic Analysis Network (HUMAnN2 V.0.99) pipeline was used to conduct a functional profile of high-quality reads [23]. Microbial metabolic pathway models produced by HUMAnN2 were derived from the MetaCyc database [24] and formed the analyses performed on microbial metabolic profiling. Taxonomic profiling was facilitated with the Kaiju taxonomic assignment software tool (V.1.5.0).
