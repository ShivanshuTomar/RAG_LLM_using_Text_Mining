In M-DSS pigs, many potentially beneficial symbiotic microbes increased, such as Lactobacillus, suggesting that some MAMPs promoted beneficial outcomes. Under such circumstances, PRRs including TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR8, NOD1 and NOD2 exhibited nonactivation compared with M-CON pigs, eliciting tolerant responses. Of course, some PRRs, such as TLR2, were activated via sensing MAMPs. Generally, TLR2 mediates the immune response to gram-positive cell wall peptidoglycan but does not affect the expression of NF-κB and MyD88 [62], shaping beneficial host immune responses. Therefore, compared to Yorkshire pigs, Min pigs might have evolved a more established strategy to modulate the structure of the colonic microbiota and manipulate PRRs pathways, resulting in less inflammation.

The gut microbiota contributes to the development of normal immunity but, when dysregulated, can promote autoimmunity and affect the immunological barrier through effects on lymphocytes [63]. GO analyses showed that the Th17-type immune response was activated, and that a plethora of proinflammatory factors was secreted in Y-DSS pigs. In addition, Th1 and cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell (Tc) cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17) were increased, suggesting that cell-mediated immunity was promoted in Y-DSS pigs via Th1, Th17 and Tc immune responses. Regarding a possible correlation with microbiota, Prevotellaceae genera were increased in Y-DSS pigs, which could stimulate epithelial cell production of IL-6, IL-8 and chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) and promote the mucosal Th17 immune response and neutrophil recruitment [64]. Stimulation of most TLRs leads to Th1 rather than Th2 differentiation [65]. The levels of some NLR and TLR genes increased in Y-DSS pigs, which were consistent with the activation of Th1 and Th17-type immune responses. Furthermore, CD8+ T-cell levels were markedly increased in the lamina propria of Yorkshire pigs. Although CD8+ T cells build a protective barrier against attack by surrounding host cells, their proliferation indicates that numerous pathogens are attacking. Accumulating evidence suggests that colitis is characterised by an expansion of colonic CD8+ T cells [66–68]. Distinct from the increase in CD8+ T cells in Y-DSS pigs, CD8+ T cells remained at steady-state levels in M-DSS pigs, but an increase in CD4+ T cells was observed. CD4+ T cells reflect immune status; higher levels indicate better immune performance. CD4+ T cells can be categorised into Th1 and Th2 cells, which drive different immune responses [69]. GO enrichment analyses of genes under immunity terms revealed CD4 T-cell activation, and acute-phase response was upregulated in Min pigs, indicating acceleration of the end of the inflammatory phase of type-1 immune response and initiation of the Th2-type immune-mediated repair phase.

Characterisation and quantification of CD4+ T cells and Th2 cytokines may also be robust evidence for supporting our interpretation of the initiation of Th2-type immune-mediated repair phase. To date, investigations found Clostridia clusters IV and XVIII [70, 71] promote CD4+ regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation and Lactobacillus plantarum D-alanylated teichoic acid [72] signals through TLR2 to modulate Treg cells, which are negative regulators of inflammation. Moreover, Lactobacillus reuteri, together with tryptophan, can reprogram intraepithelial CD4+ T cells into tolerant immunoregulatory T cells [73]. The relative abundances of these genera (Clostridia, Lactobacillus) were increased in M-DSS pigs. Additionally, tryptophan metabolism and TLR2 activation were promoted in M-DSS pigs. These data provided a possible explanation that resident bacteria in Min pigs modulated the immune response to remain tolerant and control excessive inflammatory reactions.

IgA is a major class of immunoglobulins that is produced in mucosal tissues, including in the intestine. In the intestinal lumen, IgA is produced as polymeric IgA at high concentrations [7]. Polymeric IgA is transported via pIgR, which is expressed on intestinal epithelial cells and is released into the intestinal lumen as SIgA [74]. Although the levels of pIgR, SIgA and IgA increased in both M-DSS and Y-DSS pigs, the change was more significant in Y-DSS pigs, suggesting a more robust adaptive immune response in Yorkshire pigs compared with Min pigs. Recent studies have shown a substantial correlation between gut mechanical barrier dysfunction and IBD [75]. The intestinal mechanical barrier is also strongly correlated with the microbiota and its metabolites [76]. On the one hand, numerous bacterial products regulate gut barrier function by activating the TLR and NLR pathways [77]. On the other hand, microbial metabolites (such as SCFAs, secondary bile acids and indole derivatives) produced in the gut directly influence gut barrier integrity by interacting with immune cells [78]. In this study, common functional terms related to intestinal structure and trefoil factors in the maintenance of gastrointestinal epithelium were upregulated in M-DSS pigs, indicating repair of intestinal mucosal damage in Min pigs. In addition, the analyses of colonic microbiota and metabolites and TJ proteins in the mechanical barrier provided a further explanation of the intestinal mechanical barrier dysfunction in Yorkshire pigs and intestinal mechanical barrier restoration in Min pigs. In Y-DSS pigs, depletion of members of Blautia, Eubacterium, Dorea, Butyricicoccus and Lachnospiraceae could be associated with the reduction in SCFA concentrations, resulting in obstruction of the epithelial barrier. Decreases in secondary bile acids as a factor may further
