# Exosomes and IBD

By contrast, exosomes secreted from sites of intestinal inflammation in IBD are known to promote proinflammatory factors. It is known that intestinal luminal aspirate-derived exosomes from IBD patients contain markedly higher mRNA and protein levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α than those of healthy controls. These EVs are taken up by colonic epithelial cells, resulting in upregulation of IL-8 protein and subsequent induction of macrophage migration by the epithelial cells (Mitsuhashi et al., 2016). Adherent and invasive E. coli is known to be present at high levels in the intestinal mucosa of CD patients and damages intestinal epithelial barrier integrity by regulating and disorganizing cell junction proteins to increase permeability. Exosomes expressed from these infected IECs participate in activation of the host innate immune response as well as enhancing intracellular replication of these pathogens. Activated macrophages further induce the secretion of exosomes that help to promote the proinflammatory response (Carrière et al., 2016). Chen et al. (2019b) report that exosomes derived from a dysbiotic gut microenvironment (due to triggered intestinal mucosal injury) can cause hepatic steatosis in a mouse model. These exosomes expressed by the gut had significantly high levels of high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) and were transported via the gut–liver axis to establish the hepatic steatosis (Chen et al., 2019b). On the basis of these reported dual activities of IEC-derived exosomes, there is a need to investigate the factors and mechanisms that induce the proinflammatory-associated exosomes. Treatment targets against such factors or mechanisms would be a novel approach in the treatment of IBD and other intestinal inflammatory diseases.

# IX. FUNCTIONAL MODIFICATION OF EXOSOMES

of parental cells. Armstrong, Holme, & Stevens (2017) review these modification strategies and include specific manipulation methods such as genetic engineering, which promotes gene expression and regulates transcription within recipient cells, and metabolic labelling, in which desired molecules or functional groups in the form of metabolite analogues are added to the cell’s biosynthesis. The packaging of exogenous materials into vesicles can be achieved through liposome or micelle fusion with cytoplasmic membranes. Alternatively, these molecules can be incorporated into EVs by hijacking the normal process of packaging endocytosed materials into EVs (Armstrong et al., 2017).

EV surface modification entails the decoration of vesicular surfaces with bioactive molecular particles via covalent and non-covalent manipulation methods as well as genetic methods and hydrophobic insertion. To this effect, EVs have been engineered to load molecules (including drugs) into their interior. Similarly, hydrophobic insertion has been used to insert lipophilic and amphiphilic molecules into vesicular membranes. Moreover, it is possible to modify EV membranes to become surfaces for chemical reactions. A typical example is click chemistry reactions, usually used in bio-conjugation, allowing the joining of substrates of choice with specific biomolecules on the membrane. In one study, an active alkynyl group was incorporated into exosomes by carbodiimide coupling, then attached to an azide-labelled fluorophore545 on the exosomes by click chemistry reaction (Smyth et al., 2014).

Currently, several research teams use an integrated cargo loading and membrane surface modification strategy to manipulate EVs to achieve optimal effects. Sato et al. (2016) reported that exosomes embedded with specific membrane proteins isolated from genetically modified cells could successfully fuse with several liposomes, confirming that genetic modification (parental cell manipulation) techniques can be integrated or combined with membrane manipulation methods.

With their intrinsic biodegradability and molecular payload, modification of exosomes creates exciting new ways to modulate cellular responses and develop novel nano-delivery systems in precision therapeutics (Zhu et al., 2018). Such engineered nanovesicles could enhance immunomodulation towards tissue regeneration and repair within the IBD microenvironment. They could also be utilized in the diagnosis and imaging of disease. The modification of exosomes in nanomedicine can be classified under three methods: cell cargo loading modification (parent cell manipulation); exosome membrane surface modification (direct EV functionalization); and integrated cell cargo loading and exosome membrane surface modification (Fig. 5).

# (1) Current methodological approaches

Cargo loading modification (parent cell manipulation), genetic, physical or chemical manipulation techniques are employed to load proteins, RNAs, drugs and other organic or inorganic molecules into the vesicles via the manipulation.

# (2) Application of the modified exosome and exosome-like vesicles in IBD

Based on the important roles of IL-10 in the development of normal mucosal immunity, researchers have investigated the potential for exosomes derived from DCs treated with IL-10 to suppress TNBS-induced colitis. The modified exosomes were administered intraperitoneally and the results assessed after 3 days. There was significant reduction in all clinical, histopathological and macroscopic variables associated with the induced colitis. This was noted to be linked with downregulated expression of mRNAs of IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ within the colonic tissues. This treatment resulted in significantly upregulated expression of IL-10 mRNA and Treg in colon tissues and colonic lamina propria, respectively (Yang et al., 2010). Similarly, intraperitoneal injection of exosomes derived from DCs treated with Schistosoma japonicum egg antigen significantly attenuated the severity of induced IBD in mice more effectively than untreated DC exosomes (Wang et al., 2017). Yu et al. (2013) also genetically modified DCs.
