# Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease and its Relationship with the Microbiome

Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and the phylum Actinobacteria (especially the genus Bifidobacterium) generally colonise the infant gut [33, 34]. The two most common phyla in the adult gut, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, generally dominate by the end of the first year of the infant’s life, though the healthy infant gut continues to undergo dramatic composition changes before stabilising at about age three or four [35]. Most studies agree that the infant gut microbiome closely resembles the adult gut microbiome by about age 3 years [36, 37]. Conversely, some studies argue that there are differences between the adult and child gut microbiome, such as increased abundances of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria observed in children compared to adults [38]. In addition, decreased Bacteroidetes (in pre-adolescent children) [38] and increased numbers of Bifidobacteria were seen in paediatric samples (ages 1–18) [38–40]. Potential differences in the microbiome of healthy children when compared to adults may also suggest that the microbiome of paediatric IBD may potentially differ to adult IBD microbiomes.

# The Gut Microbiome in Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis

While the exact role the microbiome plays in IBD is unclear, many studies acknowledge the complex relationship between the gut bacteria and pathogenesis of IBD, as reviewed by Wilson and Russell [41]. Various studies have investigated the unique aspects of CD and UC in paediatric patients. Increased numbers of *Escherichia coli were observed in paediatric CD stool samples but not in UC [42]. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has been observed to be decreased in paediatric CD stool samples [42, 43] and increased in colonic biopsies [44] of paediatric CD compared to UC and controls. In contrast, Olbjørn and colleagues found only Mycoplasma hominis* differed between paediatric CD and UC. Furthermore, the representatives of families Lachnospiraceae and Coriobacteriaceae were observed to be decreased in both paediatric CD and UC compared with controls, as well as the Alistipes species. Many studies have found differences between severe and milder cases of IBD, and others have seen differences between patients pre- and post-treatment. These findings have made it clear that there is a complicated and multifaceted relationship between the disease and the microbiome, though whether the microbiome plays a cause or an effect role, or perhaps a mixture of the two, has yet to be definitively proven.

A number of different bacteria have been found to be significantly changed in paediatric IBD patients, compared to controls. Table 1 contains a number of bacteria which have been found to be differentially abundant in paediatric IBD patients when compared with controls, as well as highlighting some of the microbial differences seen between UC and CD, and between varying disease states. Among those found to be decreased in paediatric IBD compared with controls are members of the *Bifidobacterium genus [29, 42, 43, 45], which are commonly considered gut commensals and markers of a healthy gut. Specifically, both Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum were decreased in paediatric IBD patients [45]. Most commonly reduced in paediatric IBD subjects are bacteria from the Firmicutes phylum, including the family Ruminococcaceae, and the genera Eubacterium and Clostridium* [29, 42, 43, 45, 46], consistent with findings in adult IBD [47].

Although many studies do report similar findings in terms of which bacterial changes are seen, there are a small number of cases where findings differ across studies. For example, Ruminococcaceae is generally reported as reduced in IBD subjects [45, 48] but in Assa et al., an increase was seen in those with IBD [49]. Of course, inter-study variation may partially be a result of differences between the study designs, such as differences in DNA extraction methods, sequencing, analysis, and of course the type of sample, be that a stool sample or a biopsy (from varying locations) [50]. Moreover, a large inter-continental study of adult IBD recently highlighted geographical changes, in terms of different lifestyle, diet and ethnicity, to account for much of the observed microbiota heterogeneity [31].

Although a reduction in microorganisms considered ‘beneficial’ is the most striking difference of the microbiome in paediatric IBD, other species appear to colonise the paediatric IBD gut microbiome. *Escherichia coli* has often found to be increased in paediatric IBD vs controls [42, 46, 51]. Interestingly, a number of studies have found bacteria typical of the oral microbiome to be increased in paediatric IBD vs controls, and in cases of severe vs mild IBD in children [29, 30, 48]. There is speculation that these species may be taking advantage of the changed environment, or potentially exasperating or driving (by inducing T helper cells) inflammation in the guts of patients with IBD [30, 52, 53]. Many of these bacteria are anaerobic, such as Veillonellaceae and Fusobacterium, or facultative anaerobes, such as Haemophilus parainfluenzae, a member of the Pasteurellaceae family.

# Disease States and Severity in Paediatric IBD

Changes in IBD from a Healthy Microbiome Variation in microbial composition can also be seen across disease states and varying with disease severity, where the gut microbiome of children with mild IBD appears closer to healthy microbiome than for more severe IBD cases. Disease
