# Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease and its Relationship with the Microbiome

in healthy controls after successful treatment of CD with EEN, but to a distinct state [65]. Although EEN is an effective treatment for CD in paediatric patients (especially those with mild to moderate disease), one major shortcoming of the treatment is implementation due to low tolerance of the diet. Due to the challenges of maintaining a liquid diet for the time required, as well as a possible reversion seen when returning to a ‘free’ diet, a recently proposed treatment regimen is a so-called CD exclusion diet (CDED), which involves a whole food diet combined with partial enteral nutrition (PEN). Levine and colleagues reported that EEN and CDED resulted in similar levels of remission achievement at week 6 of a 12-week study, but CDED was more likely to have sustained remission at week 12 [66]. Similar species alterations were observed in the two treatment groups at week 6 (decreases in Proteobacteria, Haemophilus, Veillonella (which may be linked to lactate presence as these are lactate-utilising bacteria), Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Anaerostipes and increases in Oscillibacter and Roseburia). However, at week 12, those on EEN appeared to rebound to pre-treatment levels. These divergences once EEN patients began to transition back to a free diet suggest that CDED may be a more sustainable treatment strategy for paediatric CD [66]. Another study investigating CD exclusion diets in IBD had similar findings regarding achieving remission in EEN and CDED in adult CD subjects and a small number of paediatric CD subjects [67].

Surgery is often a treatment option of last resort for refractory disease. Twenty-one OTUs (operational taxonomic unit, represents a taxonomic unit of a bacterial species or genus, clustered by sequence similarity) were associated a colectomy being required in later treatment for paediatric UC patients, and three of the OTUs that were increased were oral bacteria, which were also associated with severe disease. Twelve of those decreased were also depleted in those with severe disease [30]. Higher abundances of Proteobacteria and lower Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were found to be associated with surgery and a lack of mucosal healing in paediatric IBD [29]. Decreased levels Faecalibacterium prausnitzii have also been observed in resected adult IBD patients [31]. The findings in these studies may suggest that certain bacteria could be used as identifying markers in patients who would become medical non-responders at a later point.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may also be a potential treatment option for paediatric IBD, though it is currently not widely utilised [68]. Adult IBD studies (CD and UC) have shown success using FMT, with some patients achieving remission or showing a clinical response [69, 70]. Although a smaller number of studies are available for paediatric CD and UC, there has been some therapeutic potential suggested [71, 72]. However, other studies found that although safe, FMT did not provide any clinical benefit for some patients (adult mild to moderate UC [70], and paediatric UC [73]).

# The Virome

The viruses in the gut (the gut virome) have not been studied to the same degree as the bacteria in the gut, including those studies targeting IBD. However, it has been suggested that different abundances in the bacteriophages in the gut may also play a role in IBD [74]. The viral taxa found to be most abundant in the gut of both children and adults, irrespective of disease status, were Caudovirales and Microviridae [74, 75]. Increased richness and diversity of Caudovirales was observed in adult IBD compared with controls [74], and increased Caudovirales abundance has been reported in paediatric CD compared with UC [75]. This increase in Caudovirales was not detected in paediatric CD compared with healthy controls [60]. While increased richness of Microviridae in controls was observed compared to paediatric CD [75], this was not replicated in a more recent study, where no increased richness in adult UC or CD was seen when compared to controls [76]. The authors did however report increased diversity of Caudovirales in CD patients, but this was not seen in UC. Here, a significantly increased number of temperature phages in CD when compared with healthy controls [76].

# Mycobiome

The fungal microbiota, or mycobiome, though also less investigated than the bacterial microbiota, may show differences in the IBD gut when compared with healthy individuals. While several number of studies have observed changes in the fungal profile of IBD patients compared to healthy controls [60, 77, 78], these changes are not uniform between studies. An increased fungal abundance overall was observed in paediatric CD [60], and an increased fungal biodiversity was reported in CD, but not UC [77]. In contrast, Chehoud and colleagues reported reduced fungal diversity in paediatric IBD [79]. An adult cohort [77] and a small paediatric cohort [78] both reported Basidiomycota to be more abundant in IBD, with a corresponding decrease in Ascomycota. Malassezia (primarily Malassezia restricta) was found to be associated with CD, and responsible for the increase in basidiomycetes seen in the Limon et al. cohort of adult CD patients. Malassezia restricta was linked to adult CD patients with a disease-linked polymorphism in CARD9, and was found to exacerbate colitis in mouse models [80]. However, another study found fungi from the Ascomycota phylum to be increased in paediatric CD [60], as well as Candida albicans, which was also increased in adult IBD [77]. Another taxa, Cyberlindnera jadinii, was increased in paediatric IBD compared with controls [60, 79].
