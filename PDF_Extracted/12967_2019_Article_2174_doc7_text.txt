of IBD [134, 135]. For example, a reduced expression of antimicrobial peptides in the mucus layer and epithelial junction proteins like E-cadherin and claudins has been observed in IBD patients [136–138]. This in turn supports the excessive microbial growth in the mucus layer and helps the microbial translocation through the impaired epithelial barrier. The ingested microbial components can result in an overactivation of the different immune functions, leading to intestinal inflammation. CpG oligodeoxynucleotides in inflamed bowel have been shown to stimulate TLR9 signaling and induce the production of IFN by mucosal dendritic cells [116, 139]. IFNs can promote epithelial impairment or production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 3). Following activation, macrophages residing in the lamina propria produce a large amount of IL-6, IL-18 and IL-23 into the impaired epithelium [140]. These cytokines can activate nearby antigen presenting cells (APC) and T cells (Fig. 3); where both T helper (Th)1 and Th2 cell subsets have been shown to play a crucial role in the inflamed bowel.

# Impaired epithelial barrier functions

Fig. 3 Current understanding of the Microbial–Immune interaction models in IBD. Intestinal homeostasis involves a cross-talk between the epithelial barrier functions, the immune system and the gut microbiota. The balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the intestinal mucosa regulates the epithelial barrier functions. In IBD, various initiating factors such as genetic susceptibility, environmental factors and microbial dysbiosis have been shown to impair the epithelial barrier functions. This results in leaky epithelial barrier resulting in microbial invasion/translocation. The translocated microbes stimulate the immune cells such as dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages leading to the activation of an inflammatory cascade. The key cytokines produced by activated macrophages and DC (IL-12, IL-27, IL-4, 6, IL-23, TGFb) stimulate various T helper cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, Th9) resulting in the release of cytokines that contribute to defining the immune phenotypes of CD or UC. Activated macrophages secrete IL-12 that in turn activates the innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) and ILC1 and the release of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22 and IFN-γ (yellow box). Translocated microbes result in the activation of Natural Killer T (NKT) cells. NKT-cells proliferate and differentiate into Th2 type cells via the secretion of IL-13. In homeostasis, Paneth cells, located at the small intestinal crypt secrete various antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), defensins, transforming tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and retinoic acid. In IBD, the dysfunction of Paneth cells results in reduced AMP production and reduced signaling to regulatory T cells (Treg) resulting in a decrease of anti-inflammatory mediators. Infiltration of mucosal plasma cells is also observed in IBD patients. Black arrows indicate the direction of change in IBD. Red arrows indicate the signaling sequencing of events.
