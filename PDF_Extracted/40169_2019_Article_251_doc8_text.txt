# therapeutic effects have been documented in the use of both FMT and MSC therapies in IBD.

MSC–microbe interactions have a pronounced influence on the functions of MSC including its immunomodulation and migration, which are pivotal in the therapeutic utility of MSC across various diseases including IBD [70]. Known examples of the interaction between these two therapies are summarized in Table 3. Gastrointestinal bacteria are capable of inducing immune-regulatory mediator secretions, cytokine gene transcription and surface protein expressions in MSCs [70]. While Xiao et al. revealed that microbiota alters the differentiation potentials and improves the immunomodulation ability of bone marrow MSCs [67], another research also indicated that a restored diversity of gut microbiome reinstates bone marrow-derived MSCs from premature age-associated deterioration and loss of cell power of growth and division (senescence) [47]. Again, Nagashima et al. recently discovered a sub-epithelial mesenchymal cells which did not only induce gut microbiota diversity but also regulated the production of IgA which preserves gut symbiotic equilibrium [69]. Likewise, MSCs given by infusion caused an initial alteration in Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, which sustained intestinal mucosal function and homeostasis; believed to be valuable in hepatocyte repair [75]. Based on these findings, it could be hypothesized that FMT which seeks to restore gut microbial diversity and composition, may as well improve the functionality of MSCs and vice versa when co-administered in IBD treatment. This provides a promising area for future studies in IBD therapy. Figure 2 illustrates the main characteristic functional points of connection between the two therapies.

# Pathogenic bacteria eradication

The gut–microbiota is known to effectively contribute to host defense against pathogens by preventing their colonization [78], secreting direct target bacteriocin [79], antimicrobials peptides and RegIIIγ [80] and triggering immune cells [81]. For lack of or altered gut microbiome, germ-free and antibiotic treated mice are known to be extremely susceptible to enteric bacterial pathogens like Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella Typhimurium and Citrobacter rodentium [82, 83]. Gut microbiota mount host defense against pathogenic colonization by competitive nutrient utilization and by secreting antimicrobial factors like lactic acid, bactriocin and RegIIIγ [18] in addition to improving mucosal barrier functions and innate immunity [84]. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that MSCs significantly decreased bacteremia and mortality in sepsis partly by improving bacterial clearance and the phagocytic properties of blood monocytes [85], enhancing pathogen clearance [86] and by prostaglandin E2-dependent reprogramming of host macrophages which upregulates interleukin-10 production [87]. MSCs again, augmented the antibacterial function of neutrophil granules [88]. Harman et al. recently reported growth inhibition and cell membrane depolarization effects of equine derived/conditioned medium MSCs on S. aureus and E. coli with specific antimicrobial peptides [89] whilst Johnson et al. reported similar findings even in chronic drug-resistant bacterial infection [90]. Other antimicrobial secretomes of MSCs known to inhibit bacterial growth and/or kill them directly include cathelicidin [91], lipocalin 2 [92], elafin [89] and beta defensin 2 [93]. In the event of pathogen encounter, intestinal epithelial MSCs switch towards secretory epithelial cells differentiation [92], hence rapid proliferation and differentiation of goblet and Paneth cells. These cells produce resistin, mucin, trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), lysozyme and defensin to speed up bacterial clearance [94]. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed on intestinal epithelial cells and mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) surfaces are known to be immune regulatory receptors and present bacterial antigens to the immune system [95], thereby differentiating commensal from pathogenic microbes. While TLR2, TLR5 and TLR4 identify extracellular microbes, TLR3 specifically recognizes viral particles with TLR4 playing a crucial function as a first protective line against probable pathogenic bacteria [96]. Both MSCs (by expression) [97, 98] and microbiome [99] are known to immunologically regulate the TLRs to enhance pathogenic eradication and stimulate anti-inflammation, even against antimicrobial resistant pathogens [80].

# Anti‑inflammation

It has been shown that gut–microbiota induces the differentiation and expansion of colonic Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) [100] and the development of Th17 cells [101], both of which play roles in the regulation or suppression of other immune system cells. F. prausnitzii, was found to exert anti-inflammatory effect via producing IL-10 and inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory cytokines like IL-12 and IFN-γ [102]. The same gut bacterial is again associated with the release of anti-inflammatory molecules like salicylic acid within the gut lumen [103]. This anti-inflammatory effect is exerted on both immune cells and intestinal epithelial cells via specifically stimulating a new type of human IL-10 producing Treg cells [104] and bacterial-derived peptide inhibition of NFkB activation [105] respectively. MSCs also trigger the upregulation of several anti-regulatory modulators such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, Th17 and Th1 cells in CD and Th2 cells in UC [106, 107]. They again upregulate Treg-cells, IL-10 and TGF-β whilst decreasing IL-17 [108]. Other studies
