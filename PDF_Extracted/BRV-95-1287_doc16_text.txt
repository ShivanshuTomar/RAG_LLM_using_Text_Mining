# Exosomes and IBD

plays an important role in inducing, maintaining and regulating the required functions of intestinal tissues (Kubiritova, Radvanszky, & Gardlik, 2019). Targeting and subsequently inhibiting such exosomal constituents and mechanisms or other microenvironmental factors involved in the excessive pro-inflammatory effects of IBD would be a novel approach in both its treatment and diagnosis. Factors associated with increased expression of anti-inflammatory-mediating exosomes in intestinal tissues, resident immune cells and the gut microbiota should also be investigated.

Clinical application of nanobased drug-delivery systems is faced with two distinct problems: rapid clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) or the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and cytotoxicity. Although PEGylation could increase the circulation period of such nanoparticles, it could potentially inhibit interactions between the drug-delivery system and target cells, hence reducing the drug’s bio-distribution in diseased tissues (Suk et al., 2016). In light of this, the use of naturally equipped (endogenous) nanocarriers like exosomes as compared to synthetic nanoformulations shows promise in improving drug delivery, consequently leading to higher therapeutic efficacy due to their natural bio-compatibility in vivo (Batrakova & Kim, 2015; Peng & Mu, 2016). Several natural nanoformulations have been applied in the treatment of IBD including curcumin, ginger-derived nanoparticles, silymarin, quercetin, embelin, grape exosome-like nanoparticles and natural polysaccharides like pectin, cellulose, chitosan and dextran. They exhibit high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which enable them to modulate various inflammatory mediators efficiently, including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), iNOS, and COX-2 (Taghipour et al., 2018). The application of both natural and synthetic nanoparticles and microparticles including exosomes has demonstrated enhanced bioavailability, specificity, stability and biodistribution (Laroui et al., 2010). This method of drug delivery thus has high prospects of prolonged and stable remission in patients and reduced overall drug administration. Clinical trials will allow us to explore the use of nanobased drug-delivery products for the treatment of IBD.

The healthy subject and IBD patients release exosomes containing varying concentrations of proteins, RNAs and other constituents into circulation which could be measured as biomarkers. The abnormal expression of such biomarkers within the serum and tissues of IBD patients would indicate the onset of a molecular and genetic imbalance originating from either reduced regulatory molecules or enhanced pro-inflammatory mediators. Although few of these exosomal biomarkers are documented to date, there is great potential for the use of these exosomal components and their targets as novel diagnostic and therapeutic (by utilizing inhibitors and mimics) tools for IBD. Notwithstanding, future studies should aim to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms and factors involved. There are no clinical trials yet published on the use of this therapeutic tool in IBD. We also still require studies on the best exosome preparation method, administration route and dosage, among other factors. While stem cells and other cells produce large quantities of exosomes naturally, effective separation and purification of these continues to be difficult. There is a need to focus attention on the optimal isolation and purification procedures to allow the production of a well-defined set of pharmaceutical-grade exosome products as a next-generation cell-free therapy in regenerative medicine. The high biocompatibility of exosomes will provide greater opportunities for clinicians and medical nutritionists to develop safe and targeted therapies for the treatment and management of various conditions. Combined therapy of exosomes (or their cargos) and other existing IBD therapies should also be explored in our search for successful clinical applications.

# XIV. CONCLUSIONS

1. Chronic inflammation of the bowel is characterized by immune dysregulation, dysbiosis, and continuous destruction of IECs leading to compromised barrier integrity.
2. IBD therapies seek to regulate microenvironmental factors associated with the inflammation to restore balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory elements.
3. As an emerging therapeutic option for IBD, exosomes efficiently modulate immune system cells, the gut microbiota and IEC barrier functions to attenuate IBD.
4. Exosomes share a common basic structure mainly consisting of proteins, RNAs and lipids. These constituents are responsible for the specific effects elicited by exosomes including the possibility that they may have a clinical application as biomarkers of IBD.
5. These EVs can be manipulated chemically or biologically to broaden, change and enhance their therapeutic capability, including their use as nanocarriers or teranostic platforms with high target-specificity.
6. Given the well-documented and promising outcomes of exosome-induced modulation in IBD animal models, the stage is set for clinical trials. Future work should also continue to explore the mechanisms by which exosomes can be modulated in the hope of identifying novel therapeutic and diagnostic tools in the treatment of IBD.

# XIII. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

The highly potent modulatory effects of exosomes within the IBD microenvironment are clearly evident and well documented.
