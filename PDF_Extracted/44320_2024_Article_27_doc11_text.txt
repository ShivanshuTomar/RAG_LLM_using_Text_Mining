# Figure 5. Validation of nicotinate and NR as IBD-linked bioactives.

(A) Abundances of metabolic features in nicotinate/pantothenate-anchored module 239 that were depleted (q value < 0.1 and |effect size | ≥ 1) in CD-dysbiosis or UC and nicotinamide riboside (NR) represented by HILp_QI6481. Priority is indicated in terms of the best-observed priority score between the two disease subtypes.

(B) NAD is synthesized from Asp and Trp via the de novo pathway or from nicotinamide riboside (NR) via the salvage pathway. Microbial and host enzymes that catalyze de novo (shown in pink) and salvage reactions are indicated.

(C) Microbial enzymes catalyzing both de novo and salvage pathways were depleted in gut metagenomes during active disease i.e., IBD (particularly CD) dysbiosis (CD.dysbiosis, N = 177; CD.nondysbiosis: 555; UC.dysbiosis: 51; UC.nondysbiosis: 386).

(D) Transcription (log 2 (RPKM)) of the host enzymes catalyzing de novo (TDO2) and salvage (NRK) pathways was enriched and unchanged, respectively (CD, N = 33; UC: 21; non-IBD: 17). For the boxplots in (C, D), the bounds represent the first (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) of the data, and the line inside the box is the median. The whiskers extend to a maximum of 1.5 (IQR) from the Q1 and Q3. Values beyond the whiskers are outliers. The minima and maxima are determined by the minimum and maximum observed values within 1.5 (IQR) from Q1 and Q3, respectively.

(E) Acute DSS model used 3% daily exposure in drinking water for 5 days per mouse, and compared groups that received intraperitoneal (IP) NR vs. PBS (control).

(F) Images from hematoxylin and eosin-stained formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) slides from each group (acute DSS model), paired with histologic colitis scores (N = 20 mice per group).

(G) Chronic DSS model, using decreasing DSS percentages across three 5-day windows, again compared NR vs. PBS control.

(H) Images from Masson’s trichrome (used to highlight the chronic model’s characteristic fibrosis) stained FFPE slides from each group, (chronic colitis model) again paired with histologic colitis scores (N = 10 mice per group). Data in (F, H) represent two independent experiments and each symbol corresponds to data from an individual mouse. (F, H) Mean + SEM shown, two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test, P value < 0.05*, P value < 0.01**. Source data are available online for this figure.

Other prioritized chemical classes corresponded with broad changes in the gut microbiome concordant with dysbiosis, which may be reflective of broader consequences of host–microbe interactions. These included depletion of metabolic indicators of microbial diversity such as hippurate and hydrocinnamate, along with the enrichment of p-hydroxyphenylacetate, a product of tyrosine metabolism by clostridial and Coriobacteriaceae species that are themselves enriched in IBD (Alam et al, 2020; Lloyd-Price et al, 2019; Saito et al, 2018). Other examples of prioritized metabolite classes that also corresponded with overall microbiome disruption included pathways such as bilirubin, polyamine, and vitamin metabolism that lie at the interface of host-microbial interactions (Figs. 4B,C and 5A). Remarkably, stercobilin, polyamines, and several unannotated features were ranked even higher by MACARRoN than well-studied IBD bioactives like bile acids, bilirubin itself, and butyrate, alluding to the richness of unknown but potentially critical metabolites during inflammation.

Of these, members of the bilirubin/stercobilin pathway may be of particular interest. Both bilirubin and urobilinogen are antioxidants (Vogel and Zucker, 2016) and additionally, bilirubin has been shown to be anti-inflammatory (Zucker et al, 2015) and influence bacterial survival in the gut (Nobles et al, 2013). Both of these properties are of therapeutic interest in IBD management (Vitek and Tiribelli, 2020), motivating us to examine the 15 highly prioritized unknown features that covaried with stercobilin. We found compounds in the GNPS stercobilin molecular networks that were similar in mass to seven features that were highly prioritized by MACARRoN, supporting the chemical relatedness of the latter to bilirubins. The mass-differences associated with these features suggested small molecular additions to the tetrapyrrole backbone much like in cases of microbe-made amino acid conjugates of bile acids (Quinn et al, 2020). Notably, a recent study reported the intra-duodenal conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin-10-sulfonate by C. youngae (Shiels et al, 2019), indicating the possibility of other microbial bilirubin derivatives. Our mouse stool metabolomics data supported that two prioritized compounds were of microbial origin like stercobilin itself (Fig. 4F). Despite the small overlap between the number of prioritized and validated bilirubin-associated compounds (previous studies (Han et al, 2021; Marcobal et al, 2013; Meier et al, 2023) may be used to infer the broader overlap between (IBD-associated) human and SPF-specific metabolites belonging to other chemical classes), the findings are still notable given many factors that differentiate this system from human IBD: lower gut microbial diversity in SPF mice, markedly different diets as compared to humans, absence of inflammation as in dysbiotic human subjects, and thus, potential absence of host-derived or inflammation-linked precursor substrates. Our results here thus provide a new incentive to further characterize bilirubin pathway members in the gut. Relatedly, validation of the therapeutic benefit from NR supplementation in a mouse model of colitis is an encouragement to further study the prioritized bioactives for therapeutic bioprospecting.

MACARRoN’s strategy for compound prioritization and identification is fundamentally different from that of existing guilt-by-association methods such as GNPS (Wang et al, 2016), xMSAnnotator (Uppal et al, 2017), and MetNet (Naake and Fernie, 2019) that are also designed for chemically annotating features. Each method uses some combination of properties including m/z, RT, fragmentation spectra, and covariance to associate and annotate metabolic features. However, MACARRoN is uniquely able to leverage microbial community profiles, as well as the intuition that covariation captures molecular functional relatedness as previously used for protein function prediction (Zhou et al, 2005). It also combines these and other more basic properties such as prevalence and abundance with respect to a known metabolite with phenotypic “importance” in prioritization of potential bioactivity, i.e., the likelihood of its causal or consequential involvement in a phenotype or an environment of interest. This simultaneously indicates which of potentially thousands of unidentified compounds may be most important to experimentally validate, and what putative identities they might be validated to have. Although MACARRoN does not use properties such as the m/z or RT directly, these can still be used post hoc to make informed guesses about the identity of an unannotated metabolite that covaries with a known metabolite.

This combination of methodology provides MACARRoN with several advantages relative to other approaches. Unlike annotation methods that associate metabolic features using covariance and filter associations based on chemical properties (e.g., xMSAnnotator (Uppal et al, 2017), MetNet (Naake and Fernie, 2019)), MACARRoN uses only covariance. This can be either a strength or a weakness—it loses the specificity provided by spectral similarity (when available), but it does not require this additional data to operate and can thus prioritize bioactive compounds that are less.
