# 6.6. GPCRs for Citric Acid Cycle Intermediates

GPR91. The GPR91 (SUCNR1) receptor is activated by succinate coupled to G-type Gi proteins [145]. The liver, heart, adipose tissue, intestine, spleen, and immune cells, including DCs express GPR91 [108, 146–148]. GPR91 has a possible role in renovascular hypertension. Indeed, the succinate-induced hypertensive effect involves the renin-angiotensin system and is abolished in GPR91-deficient mice [145]. In the immune system, GPR91 appears to play a pro-inflammatory role. In this regard, DCs expressing GPR91 enhance their immuno-stimulatory potential in a GPR91-dependent manner [147]. Furthermore, GPR91-deficient mice have a reduced production of IL-1β by macrophages during antigen-induced arthritis [149].

GPR31. GPR31 expressed in macrophages (133) has been identified as a target receptor for 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [150]. GPR31 plays a crucial role in inflammation and tumor progression [151]. Possibly, lactate and pyruvate contribute to enhanced immune responses by inducing GPR31-mediated dendrite protrusion of intestinal CX3CR1+ phagocytes [152]. Moreover, elevated GPR31 expression levels were reported in colorectal cancer tissue as compared to normal mucosa [153].

# 7. Metabolite-Sensing GPCRs and Inflammatory Bowel Disease

The use of axenic mice is one of the most straightforward examples that shows the importance of commensal organisms in the development of a functional immune system [154, 155]. However, the exact molecular mechanisms by which the gut flora shapes the immune system remain to be explored. On the other hand, increasing evidence showed that bacterial-derived metabolites play a crucial role in the development of the immune system via metabolite-sensing GPCRs.

Metabolite-sensing GPCRs are present in immune, mesenchymal, and epithelial cells of the gut, where their ligands are synthesized in high concentrations by the gut microbiota or derived from nutritional content. GWAS studies have established a link between IBD and the metabolites sensing-GPCRs, in this context, GPR35 [121] and GPR65 [140, 141] are considered among the IBD-risk genes. Clinically, administration of SCFAs, mainly butyrate ameliorated intestinal inflammation [46, 47, 156] is by signaling through metabolite-sensing GPCRs. Macia et al. [51] have shown that dietary fiber protects from DSS-induced colitis via GPR43 and GPR109A in mice. Furthermore, loss of GPR35 in knockout mice aggravated the intestinal inflammation in DSS-induced experimental colitis [157]. Additionally, the activation of GPR35 by pamoic acid significantly reduced the severity of DSS-induced colitis [158]. Another study has reported that GPR41−/− and GPR43−/− mice had reduced inflammatory responses after administration of ethanol or TNBS compared to control mice, and had a limited immune response against C. rodentium infection [89]. Similarly, the loss of GPR43 in mice exacerbated inflammation in DSS-induced colitis and the administration of acetate reduced the severity of colitis in wild-type mice but not in mice lacking GPR43, suggesting that acetate exerts its anti-inflammatory role via GPR43 [71]. Furthermore, epithelial cells expressing the IBD-associated missense variant, GPR65 I231L, displayed aberrant lysosomal pH, resulting in lysosomal dysfunction and impaired bacterial restriction [159].

Despite the high number and quality of pieces of evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory functions of metabolite-sensing GPCRs, other studies showed that some metabolite-sensing GPCRs might exert a pro-inflammatory role in the gut. The production of IL-8 and TNF-α by LPS-stimulated neutrophils and macrophages respectively was increased by activation of GPR84 with natural and synthetic agonists [160]. Similarly, GPR91 plays a pro-inflammatory role as it has been demonstrated that LPS stimulation of macrophages increases the levels of succinate, which subsequently drives IL-1β production by macrophages [161].
