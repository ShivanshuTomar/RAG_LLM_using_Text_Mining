Pigs, tight junction (TJ) proteins such as occludin (OCLN), claudin (CLDN-1) and zonula occludens (ZO-1) were downregulated in Y-DSS pigs (P < 0.05) (Fig. 9d). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Yorkshire pigs are more susceptible to inflammatory stimuli, leading to sustained inflammation.

# Discussion

Within the gut, the colon is home to the densest and most metabolically active community (comprising more than 1013 individual microbial cells) [27]. Although colitogenic pathobionts promote IBD development, commensal bacteria are also crucial for reducing IBD susceptibility [7]. The protective effect of commensal bacteria is evident from studies using germ-free mice, which are more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis than conventionally housed mice [28, 29]. The microbiota may have a major role in gut health, including the maturation of host immune responses, protection against enteric pathogen proliferation and response to or modification of specific drugs [6]. In the present study, diseased Min pigs exhibited mild organismal damage, as indicated by lower values of the body weight loss, stool consistency and haematochezia scores and limited mucosal disease and crypt loss, bolstering interest in whether changes in microbiota were associated with disease resistance. Important host-microbiota interactions in Min pigs are likely crucial for host physiology and the disease phenotype. We integrated microbiota sequencing, metabolomics and transcriptomics to investigate the host-microbiota crosstalk mechanisms that contribute to disease resistance.

In this study, all results for the acute colitis models were analysed separately for Min pigs and Yorkshire pigs. Progress to date indicates that IBD is a polymicrobial disease in which a combination of various gut microbial factors, abnormal immune responses and a weakened intestinal mucosal barrier leads to aberrant host-microbial interactions [30]. Intriguingly, the disease responses of the two breeds were not identical, although both exhibited inflammation. Consistent with many previous assessments of changes in microbiota in IBD [20, 31, 32], Y-DSS pigs exhibited a reduction in Firmicutes and increases in Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes with Y-CON pigs. Surprisingly, however, similar changes were not observed in Min pigs. In contrast to Yorkshire pigs, M-DSS pigs displayed an increase in Firmicutes and major reductions in Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes. At the genus level, more specific shifts were clearly observed. The higher incidence of populations of members of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in the colonic mucosa of IBD patients has been reported [20, 21]. Our data demonstrated that Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio, as members of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, respectively, were enriched in diseased individuals of the two breeds. Still, the extent and severity of these changes were less pronounced in Min pigs than in Yorkshire pigs. Increases in these bacteria are a frequent finding in IBD-associated dysbiosis, suggesting that these bacteria might function as potentially harmful microbes and play roles in the pathogenesis of the disease. A possible mechanism by which members of Bacteroidetes and Prevotella influence the severity of colitis is by removing sulphate from mucin with sulfatases, resulting in mucin degradation [33–35]. In addition, Desulfovibrio, as a sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB), increases the concentration of hydrogen sulphide, eroding the intestinal epithelium [36]. Therefore, dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota might contribute to inflammation by an impairment of intestinal barrier. In our study, downregulated OCLN, CLDN-1 and ZO-1 levels were observed in Y-DSS pigs, which were consistent with our inference of intestinal barrier alteration with the role of microbes. Thus, it seems plausible to infer that more aggravative compromised intestinal barrier and more aggressive translocation of bacteria in Yorkshire pigs might influence each other, together exacerbating inflammation.

Additional key characteristics of dysbiosis in Y-DSS pigs were enrichment of Gammaproteobacteria, Bilophila, Veillonella, Sutterella, Alistipes and Prevotella and depletion of Blautia, Eubacterium, Dorea, Butyricicoccus and Lachnospiraceae. According to the Spearman’s rank correlation network, we found that the increases in Bilophila, Alistipes and Bacteroidetes in the colons of Yorkshire pigs were inversely correlated with the changes in acetate, deoxycholic acid and nutriacholic acid. The higher abundances of bile-tolerant microbes (Bilophila, Alistipes and Bacteroidetes) indicated that these bacteria might be the main contributors to the disruption of bile acid metabolism [37–39]. As supportive evidence, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, involved in bile acid metabolism, were enriched both in KEGG profiles of microbiota and metabolite in Yorkshire pigs. Furthermore, members of
