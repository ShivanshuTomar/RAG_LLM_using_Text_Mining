of the beneficial Lachnospiraceae NK4A136. Conversely, a negative correlation was observed between the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the presence of pathogenic bacteria (Additional file 1: Fig. S7). Besides, YBNs@PDA treatment potently protected colon length from DSS-induced shortening and lowered the DAI scores, indicating a significant decreased colonic inflammation in mice (Fig. 7C and D and Additional file 1: Fig. S8).

# Moderation of colitis in a delay setting of treatment

Lastly, we assessed the therapeutic potential of YBNs@PDA when administered at a later stage of disease progression in mice with acute colitis. Mice were initially treated with 2.5% DSS added in the water for 5 days to induce colitis, and randomly divided into four groups: PBS, YBNs and YBNs@PDA (two dosages) (Fig. 7A). On day 8 of the experiment, oral administration with YBNs@PDA showed an earlier recovery in body weight.

In the epithelium, the number of apoptotic cells has been observed to decrease significantly. Representative immune-fluorescence images and western blot show increased occludin and claudin-1 at 110 - Walet.
