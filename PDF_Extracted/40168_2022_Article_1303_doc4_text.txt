# Min pig

# Yorkshire pig

# DAI values

Min pigs and Yorkshire pigs were administered CON (control, sterile saline) or DSS (4% DSS in 100 mL of water) via gavage for 5 days. The first dose had a volume of 200 mL.

# Histological activity index (HAI)

Comparison of spleen coefficient, colon coefficient and colon length in Min pigs and Yorkshire pigs after DSS treatment (n = 8 samples/group).

# Distal colon inflammation and histopathology score

Min pigs and Yorkshire pigs after DSS treatment (n = 5 samples/group). Scale bar, 200 μm.

Data are presented as the mean ± SEM and were analysed by the t-test; significance is reported as *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01
