and statistical analysis was consistent for these samples, a vast array of technical (e.g. duration of storage) and environmental variability (e.g. diet) exists between the cohorts, highlighting the challenges of comparing and interpreting AS microbiomes across different studies.

To investigate potential associations between the gut microbiome and disease characteristics of AS, we studied Australian intestinal biopsies from several sites as well as stool samples and excluding patients not undergoing TNFi treatment. Significant differences in beta diversity according to BASDAI (Fig. 3) were observed, however no significant correlation with Dialister was observed, contrary to previous findings [22]. Consistent with previous results, we also noted a significant difference in beta diversity for AS patients with elevated FCP (>100 μg/mg) (Fig. 4). The same effect was also noted for IBD patients in terms of beta diversity, as well as a notable increase in alpha diversity for patients with FCP greater than 100 μg/mg (Fig. 4C), potentially reflecting an increase in the number of inflammatory bacterial taxa.

Previous study of the AS stool microbiome using a GA-map™ Dysbiosis Test in the Swedish cohort revealed an association between dysbiosis and elevated faecal calprotectin levels, but no such association was observed for disease activity assessed by BASDAI [25]. In the current study, when considering changes in the overall microbiome composition, as opposed to association with individual species as conducted in the Swedish study, we note no significant association with FCP (Supplementary Fig. 1). We also noted a significant difference in microbiome composition between individuals with BASDAI 0 to 2.5 versus 5 to 7.5, yet no other BASDAI categories (Supplementary Fig. 1). Consistent with previous reports [25] we note a significant depletion of Faecalibacterium in patients with elevated FCP, but we also note an enrichment of several potentially inflammatory genera. A full list of differentially abundant taxa according to BASDAI and FCP are available in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

Bacterial genera which were significantly enriched or depleted in at least two of the following six categories are summarised in Fig. 5: AS patients, AS-IBD patients, IBD patients, patients with increased BASDAI, and AS or IBD patients with FCP >100 μg/mg. The potentially pathogenic genera Streptococcus and Haeomophilus were noted to be enriched in AS patients, IBD patients, and AS patients with concomitant IBD (AS-IBD). Also of note, Haeomophilus was also found to be enriched in patients with increased BASDAI and IBD patients with elevated FCP. Other than these two genera, no other similarities were noted between diseases. Four genera were noted to be enriched in IBD patients and
