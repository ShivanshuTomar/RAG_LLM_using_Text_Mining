The outcomes of this study may also help us better understand the interplay between commensal bacteria and viruses leading to more effective therapies and prevention techniques for mucosal transmission of viruses. Our studies also provide an impetus to continue investigating the role of viruses in the etiology of IBD.

- Additional file 1: Supplemental Table 1. Overlapping MMTV Gag peptides.
- Additional file 2: Supplementary Fig. 1. Alignment of Illumina reads from IL-10-/- lactoserum library to MMTV genome showing a screen capture with alignment of 2,886,869 million Illumina reads along MMTV reference genome with variance in sequence marked in red, to provide 99.40% coverage of the MMTV genome and an average read depth of 67,017-fold.
- Additional file 3: Supplementary Fig. 2. T cell receptor (TCR)-Vβ subset distribution in spleen and colon of IL-10-/- vs. SvEv mice assessed by Illumina sequencing. (A) No significant differences were observed between IL-10-/- vs SvEv in the spleen. (B) the IL-10-/- colon had increased TCR-Vβ12 and TCR-Vβ16 subsets with diminished TCR-Vβ2, TCR-Vβ14 and TCR-Vβ15 expression. [Mean±SEM, TCR-Vβ subsets with percent less < 0.5% removed from the analyses. * p<0.01, ** p=0.002, Multiple unpaired t-test, Benjamini, Kreiger, and Yekutieli two stage set up, q value < 0.1].
- Additional file 4: Supplementary Fig. 3. Correlation of colon MMTV RNA levels and histology score [Spearman, p=0.082].
- Additional file 5: Supplementary Fig. 4. Pro-inflammatory cytokines in colonic extracts showing that levels of IL-1b, IL-12p70, IL-4, and IL-5 were not significantly altered with cART in the IL-10-/- mice [Mean±SEM].
