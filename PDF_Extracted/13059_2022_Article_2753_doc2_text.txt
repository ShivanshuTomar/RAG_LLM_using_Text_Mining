Ten uniformly processed 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies of the IBD mucosal/stool microbiomes. For longitudinal cohorts, numbers in parentheses indicate baseline sample size. For age, mean and standard error (parenthesized) are shown. Additional covariates are summarized in Additional file 3: Table S1

longitudinal sampling, pediatric and adult populations, diseases (CD and UC), treated and treatment-naive patients, biopsy and stool samples, and inclusion of healthy/non-IBD controls. Covariates were manually curated to ensure consistency across studies (“Methods”). Major factors available from all or most studies included demographics (age/sex/race), biogeography, disease location and/or extent, antibiotic usage, immunosuppression, and steroid and/or 5-ASA usage.
