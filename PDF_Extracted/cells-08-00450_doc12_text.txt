Gnotobiotic mice, allowing for controlled in vivo investigation of the interaction between a specific strain and the host, by eliminating background signals coming from the rest of the gut microbiome. The effect of a specific diet in gnotobiotic animals colonized with a defined single or a consortium of microorganism can be investigated in this well-defined experimental setup. On the other hand, it is essential to keep in mind that gnotobiotic mice model and other factors (including birth mode of delivery, feeding’s mode (breast or bottle), diet, medical history, and social activities, which shape the human microbiota differently than the murine microbiota, does not reflect a ‘real-life’ gut microbiota. Furthermore, germ-free and gnotobiotic mice have an altered structure of the intestine as highlighted by an enlarged ceocum. Genetically modified animals that harbor inducible deletions of metabolite-sensing GPCRs known to modulate microbiota-host interactions, could serve as an alternative to study underlying mechanisms. The application of single-cell RNA sequencing significantly increased our perception to grasp relevant pathways associated with metabolite signaling. The next step would be to apply in vitro approaches by using cell lines and patient-derived organoids to monitor the effect of specific metabolites. Implementing single or multiple deletions of candidate GPCRs, and associated signaling partners, by using siRNA or Crispr/Cas9 methods in combination with varying doses of metabolites, will help in the understanding of mechanistical functioning of both ligands/receptors and signaling pathways.

# 10. Metabolite-Sensing GPCRs for the Treatment of IBD: What Are the Challenges?

The opportunity to manipulate the host immune system, through metabolite-sensing GPCRs, by small-molecules, will offer excellent potential for the treatment of IBD. However, metabolite-sensing GPCRs research comes with many challenges. In this regard, bacterial metabolites, such as butyrate, can exert anti-inflammatory effects either through HDAC inhibition or through metabolite-sensing GPCRs. Furthermore, metabolite-sensing GPCRs also signal through β-arrestin-2, which typically produces anti-inflammatory effects, and not only through G-proteins. Thus, it is essential to understand whether bacterial metabolites exert beneficial effects through HDAC inhibition, β-arrestin-2 signaling or signaling through G-proteins. In order to define possible treatments for IBD each of these different pathways needs to be further studied.

The metabolite-sensing GPCRs GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A can recognize with high affinity different bacterial metabolites (e.g., butyrate) and the same ligand can bind to different GPCRs indicating redundance in this system. Moreover, SCFAs, can alter local pH and possibly activate pH-sensing GPCRs as well along with their main GPCRs. Further studies are needed to dissect this highly redundant system before target therapies can be developed.

The vast and varied systemic expression pattern and function of some metabolite-sensing GPCRs is another challenging aspect. Indeed, activation of GPR109A by niacin induces flushing in dermal Langerhans cells through increases of prostaglandin D2 and prostaglandin E2 and causing cutaneous vasodilatation. Moreover, many GPCRs ligand can activate different pathways. For example, β-2-adrenergic receptor, agonists for the arrestin/MAP kinase pathway are also inverse agonists for the classical Gαs/cAMP/PKA pathway. Despite these confusing aspects, pharmacological compounds and existing ligands for targeting specific GPCRs provide a useful toolbox together with genetic models to solve these issues.

# 11. Conclusions

Shortly after their discovery, metabolite-sensing GPCRs became a favorable target for the development of new therapeutic tools. Most of these metabolite-sensing receptors are expressed in the gut where metabolites are produced in large numbers and amounts. Accordingly, recent high-profile publications pointed out their importance in regulating intestinal inflammation. A deeper understanding of how diet and metabolites, including bacteria- and host-derived metabolite and their GPCRs influence the intestinal homeostasis, and will undoubtedly be important in the elucidation of connections between diet, microbiome, and IBD, allowing the development of new approaches for the prevention and the treatment of patients with IBD.
