# Functional changes in gut microbiota on clinical outcomes following FMT in patients with IBD

Conclusions

There is a significant increase in microbial diversity in patients with recurrent CDI after FMT. Both the degree of microbial engraftment or donor type (related or unrelated) are not the key for successful treatment of recurrent CDI by FMT. Compared to CDI patients without IBD, CDI patients with IBD have higher proportion of the original microbial communities after FMT and increased episodes of future CDI on long-term follow-up.
