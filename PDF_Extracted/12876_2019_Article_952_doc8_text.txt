# Properties that were not assessed in this study

This is highly likely given the emerging evidence for exercise-induced suppression of inflammation [4, 29]. The importance of the finding lies in the metabolic benefits of improving long-term body composition given the increasing risk of obesity and metabolic complications in patients with IBD [30, 31]. This study should reassure patients and clinicians that exercise is safe and desirable and can quickly lead to objectively verifiable improvements in lean tissue mass. Reversing or preventing sarcopenia in patients with IBD, irrespective of BMI, is an important goal [9, 10].

# Influence of exercise on the gut microbiome

This prospective trial also provided us with the opportunity to explore the influence of exercise on the gut microbiome of patients with IBD. Recently, research is converging on the ability of physical activity on multiple facets of the hepatobiliary-gut axis including the gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism [32]. Reassuringly, and contrary to some evidence that exercise has the potential to aggravate gut symptomatology [33], combined aerobic and resistance exercise of moderate-intensity did not have detrimental effects on the composition or diversity of the gut microbiome. The results demonstrate similar findings to our previous study in healthy but physically inactive volunteers, where only modest changes in the composition and functional capacity of the gut microbiome occurred following a short-term period of fitness improvement through an identical moderate exercise program [15]. It is important to distinguish the effects of short term exercise from the physiological changes that occur with sustained fitness or prolonged high-intensity exercise. This remains to be assessed in patients with IBD [6]. Indeed, high-intensity exercise may lead to superior metabolic benefits and might induce favourable changes in the bacterial microbiome in patients with IBD, similar to what has been observed in professional athletes [34, 35].

# Comparison with other studies

The majority of exercise-intervention studies in patients with IBD have focused on low-impact, aerobic activities such as walking and almost all studies have been uncontrolled [7]. One randomized controlled trial of moderate intensity outdoor running (three times per week for 10 weeks) demonstrated improved quality of life measures in patients with mild to moderately active Crohn’s and Colitis. No adverse events or worsening of symptoms were reported over a 10-week period [36], supporting efforts to recommend physical activity for patients with IBD [11].

Despite established evidence for resistance training in cancer-related sarcopenia [37], only one, non-randomized study has examined strength training in IBD reporting good compliance and improvement in muscle strength with the prescribed exercise program (thrice-weekly, 12 resistance exercises at 60–70% of one repetition maximum) [38]. There was good compliance with the exercise programme in the present study which is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the role of resistance training in patients with IBD.

# Strengths and limitations

The strengths of this study are several-fold. The cohort of patients examined in this trial represents a group who can harness meaningful benefit from lifestyle interventions to improve their metabolic health. At recruitment, patients in this study were unfit, predominantly overweight or obese, with high body fat percentages, placing them at risk of future metabolic disorders. Following intervention, this cohort successfully demonstrated improvements in body composition in a short period of time. Despite their disease inactivity at study entry, a large proportion of study participants (almost half) had required corticosteroids for disease flare in the previous 12 months, and all patients were on disease-controlling medication. This indicates that patients at risk of disease flare in the near-future can also benefit from body composition improvement with exercise and engage in combined exercise programs without undue concern for their symptoms. The cross-over design of this study also represents a strength of this study, reducing the impact that additional contributory variables (e.g. age, gender, previous exercise history) may have on the primary outcome response to exercise intervention by homogenizing these factors in the exercising and non-exercising control groups. This is a recognized advantage of this type of trial design [39].

The study was limited to patients in remission. Other limitations relate to the relatively short-term follow up and sample size of the group which may have been underpowered to detect meaningful changes in secondary outcomes. Future studies should be extended to those patients with co-existing IBD and metabolic disorders including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and type two diabetes, who may benefit the most from exercise. Furthermore, although analysis of the gut microbiome was not the primary endpoint of interest, inclusion of samples from two patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics mid-way through the study, may be an unavoidable confounder. Nevertheless, gut microbial analysis remained consistent across both exercising and control groups.

# Conclusions

The simple but important ‘take-home’ message for patients and their doctors is that short-term combined aerobic and resistance training will achieve favourable objective changes in body composition in patients with.
