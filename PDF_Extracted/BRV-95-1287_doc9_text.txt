# Exosomal lipids

Lipids are indispensable constituents of the exosome membrane, and it is known that specific lipids are enriched in exosomes relative to their parental cells. Recent investigations have focussed on the functions and composition of exosomal lipids, with over 1,116 lipid molecules recorded in one database (Keerthikumar et al., 2016). Lipid composition analyses have been performed with exosomes derived from mast cells, DCs, reticulocytes, B cells, and basophilic leukaemia cells (Mathivanan et al., 2012). Notwithstanding, the roles of exosomal lipids and their possible use in therapeutics have not received sufficient attention. Lipids play important roles in exosome biogenesis and are characteristic of the cell type from which the exosomes originate: internal membranes of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) are enriched with lipids such as lyosbisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) which has important functions in exosome biogenesis, especially in intraluminal vesicle (ILV) formation (Chu, Witte, & Qi, 2005; Mathivanan et al., 2012). Exosome-like nanoparticles obtained from grapes (GELNs) effectively protected mice from induced colitis, with further analysis indicating that the lipid components of the exosome-like liposome-like nanoparticles (LLNs) assembled with lipids from GELNs were required for in vivo targeting of intestinal stem cells (Ju et al., 2013).

# V. IMMUNE CELL-DERIVED EXOSOMES AND IBD

Exosomes derived from macrophages and monocytes enriched with lipids such as LBPA provide an unparalleled opportunity to escape the control of mononuclear phagocytes to improve drug delivery to target sites and increase the therapeutic efficacy of drugs (Haney et al., 2015). Macrophages are polarized into M1 macrophages or M2 macrophages depending on the activation pathway. While classical activation leads to M1 macrophages which produce proinflammatory cytokines, the alternative leads to M2 macrophages which initiate anti-inflammatory responses. The effects of exosomes derived from M2 macrophage subtypes M2a, M2b, and M2c have been studied in experimental colitis in mice. The results show that M2b macrophage-derived exosomes greatly mitigate the severity of induced colitis by upregulating levels of regulatory T cells (Treg) and IL-4, and downregulating levels of the colitis-associated cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-17A) via the C-C motif chemokine ligand 1/8 (CCL1/CCR8) axis (Yang et al., 2019). Wang et al. (2016b) conducted a study to investigate the influence of exosomes obtained from granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells on DSS-induced murine colitis. Mice treated with the exosomes exhibited higher resistance to colitis and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration damage via the inhibition of T helper type 1 (Th1) cell proliferation and colonic inflammation (Xiong et al., 2016).

The influence of exosomes derived from DCs treated with IL-10 on colitis is also documented. It was shown that treatment with the exosome attenuated all the analysed macroscopic, clinical and histopathologic variables associated with colitis. Colonic tissue mRNA expression levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 were significantly reduced while IL-10 mRNA and Treg expression levels increased (Yang et al., 2010). The mechanism by which these forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)-positive Treg cells prevent diseases like IBD was investigated by Okoye et al. (2014) who showed that Treg utilizes a mechanism of non-cell-autonomous gene silencing via the mediation of miRNA-containing exosomes to inhibit T-
