# Integrating 10 studies of the IBD stool and mucosal microbiomes

We collected and uniformly processed ten published 16S studies of the IBD gut microbiome (Table 1, Fig. 1a, Additional file 1: Figs. S1-S4, Additional file 2: Supplemental Notes, Additional file 3: Table S1) totaling 2179 subjects and 5151 samples. These studies range widely in terms of cohort designs and population characteristics, including recent-onset and established disease patients, cross-sectional and...

sample sizes, remains undetermined. Likewise, it is unclear whether reproducible population structure in the microbiome, such as microbially driven IBD “subtypes,” exists to help explain the clinical heterogeneity of these conditions [9].

Meta-analysis of microbial community profiles presents unique quantitative challenges relative to other types of ‘omics data such as GWAS [10] or gene expression [11]. These include particularly strong batch, inter-individual, and inter-population differences, and statistical issues including zero inflation and compositionality [12, 13]. Consequently, methods to correct for cohort and batch effects from other ‘omics settings [14–17] are not directly appropriate. Two recent studies have suggested quantile normalization [18] and Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial regression (BDMMA) [19] for microbial profiles, which are applicable to a limited subset of differential abundance tests and do not provide batch-corrected profiles. To date, there are no methods permitting the joint analysis of batch-corrected microbial profiles for most study designs.

IBD represents one of the best-studied, microbiome-linked inflammatory phenotypes to date which thus stands to benefit from such approaches [20, 21]. Among the inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have been individually linked with structural and functional changes in the gut microbiome in many individual studies [21]. Each of CD and UC can itself be highly heterogeneous within the IBD population, however, and diversity in disease-associated gut microbial features has not been consistently associated with factors including disease subtype, progression, or treatment response [7, 9, 22, 23]. Of note, two meta-analysis studies included IBD as one of several phenotypes [24, 25]. These studies were not IBD-specific, did not have access to appropriate normalization techniques, nor took the aforementioned factors into account. The complexity of microbial involvement in IBD, and the presence of substantial unexplained variation in the manifestation of its symptoms, makes it particularly appropriate for application of meta-analysis techniques.

In this work, we introduce and validate a statistical framework for population-scale meta-analysis of microbiome data, and apply it to the largest collection to date of ten published 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based IBD studies (Table 1) to identify consistent disease associations and population structure. We found both previously documented and novel microbial links to the disease, with further differentiation among subtypes, phenotypic severity, and treatment effects. We further confidently conclude that there are no apparent, reproducible microbiome-based subtypes within CD or UC, which are instead a population structure gradient from less to more “pro-inflammatory” ecological configurations. Our work thus represents one of the first large-scale efforts to assess consistency in gut microbial findings for IBD and provides methodology supporting future microbial community meta-analyses.
