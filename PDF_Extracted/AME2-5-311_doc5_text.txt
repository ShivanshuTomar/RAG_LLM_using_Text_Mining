# 4.2 Intestinal microbiota is important in initiation and progression of IBD

As reviewed earlier, IBD commonly displays intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. However, understanding the dysbiosis of IBD patients and experimental colitis is insufficient to investigate the potential role of the microbiome in the development, progression, and treatment of IBD. The relation of intestinal microbiota and IBD can be well defined by the disease activity, which is more evident in the colon than the small intestine and rectum where the bacterial populations are relatively lower. Most experimental IBD models only develop in the presence of conventional microbiota, while GF mice fail to develop intestinal inflammation. It is agreed that constant gut dysbiosis seems to be a key factor in the aggravation of the inflammation, which has been supported by a higher abundance of adherent and invasive bacteria Fusobacteria. Fusobacterium spp. were reported to be higher in the colonic mucosa of UC patients when compared with healthy controls. Following research studies revealed the ability of Fusobacterium spp. in adhering to and invading colonic epithelial cells, as well as positive correlation of this bacterium with the severity of IBD, indicating the role of Fusobacterium spp. in fascinating the progression of IBD and may be a useful biomarker for gastrointestinal disease.

In addition, colonization with mucosa-associated microbes of UC patients was able to increase the susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis instead of inducing spontaneous colitis in gnotobiotic BALB/c mice. In other studies, mice that received fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from UC patients with low Firmicutes were more sensitive to colitis compared with those received from fecal or synthetic ecosystems enriched in Firmicutes. Besides, elevated proinflammatory gene expression profile was reported in GF mice colonized by disturbed intestinal microbiota isolated from CD patients causing inflammatory tissue damage.

Except for these human clinical trials and corresponding experimental data, accumulating evidence obtained from mouse models provides convincing data for a key causal role of intestinal microbiota in the development of intestinal inflammation. For example, an underlying mechanism of epithelium damage in DSS and acetic acidâ€“induced colitis is attributed to dysregulated immune responses activated by resident microbiota, which indicates the key causal role of commensal microbiota in the onset of IBD. Of note, GF and antibiotic-treated mice provide an excellent research tool to investigate the role of bacteria in colitis. A study concluded that GF mice treated with 1% DSS resulted in severe colitis in comparison with conventionally reared mice, whereas GF mice treated with 5% DSS failed to induce colitis lesions, but induced moderate colitis in conventional mice. The contradictory result may be attributed to the high toxicity of DSS to GF mice and death prior to colitis development because of the massive bleeding into the intestinal lumen.

# 4.3 Dysregulated metabolite production links to IBD pathogenesis

Numerous studies revealed that the disrupted metabolites as a result of dysbiosis are linked to the pathogenesis of IBD.
