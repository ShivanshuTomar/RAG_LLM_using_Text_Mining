directly related to characterized precursors or derivatives. Apropos, it is notable in these results that despite the absence of chemical property-based filtering, most covariance-based modules are chemically homogeneous (Fig. 2B). Moreover, metabolites from the same GNPS molecular networks were also found to have correlated abundances by MACARRoN (Fig. 2C), although the latter does not rely on spectral information. MACARRoN can thus analyze low molecular weight metabolites that do not have complex spectra even when MS2 profiles are generated. This makes the method particularly suitable for identifying microbially processed small molecules such as amino acids, polyamines, SCFAs, and other derivatives of common molecular classes. In this regard, it is important to note that the prioritization schema itself is agnostic to the source or origin of metabolite i.e., MACARRoN will prioritize both microbial and non-microbial metabolites, however, in microbiome-linked phenotypes such as IBD, the prioritized metabolic features are expected to be enriched for microbially derived small molecules. Finally, MACARRoN does not require curated biochemical pathway information such as KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) or MetaCyc (Caspi et al, 2016), making it appropriate for less well-studied environments such as microbial communities. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, MACARRoN is the only tool that couples characterization with prioritization based on the likelihood of bioactivity, i.e., chemical involvement in a phenotype of interest. This step is instrumental for efficiently selecting the most promising metabolites for further characterization.

Conversely, MACARRoN of course also has limitations, the most striking being the nearly 50% of highly prioritized metabolites not associated with any standard, rendering their characterization nearly impossible by these methods. Relatedly, chemically identifying metabolites using only chemical properties and mass-differences with respect to co-clustered standards is nontrivial. The uncertainty in identifying a metabolite arises from multiple underlying phenomena such as abiotic fragmentation and adduct formation in the mass-analyzer, transformations that involve the simultaneous removal and addition of moieties, and ambiguity between Δm/zs (e.g., Δm/zs near 44 are associated with both carboxyl and amido groups). It may thus be potentially useful to couple the system with tools such as BioTransformer (Djoumbou-Feunang et al, 2019) and MetWork (Fox Ramos et al, 2019) that predict metabolic products obtained from the host or microbial metabolism of a parent compound. MACARRoN can also be used in tandem with related systems for MS1 metabolomes such as xMSAnnotator (Uppal et al, 2017) and MetNet (Naake and Fernie, 2019) for the chemical identification of prioritized metabolites. Additional limitations arise in the optimization of MACARRoN’s methodological parameters including the requirement of sufficient samples per phenotype for detecting significant correlations; accompanied by challenges routinely associated with clustering such as optimizing cluster size and membership. While we expect the defaults to work for most real-world metabolomics datasets, to determine if the modules generated using default parameters are appropriate for downstream prioritization steps, we provide the users descriptive statistics pertaining to the number of modules, singletons, and chemical homogeneity of the modules, as well as the option to adjust the defaults. We also recognize that different metabolites are bioactive at different concentrations and therefore, determine the ecological relevance of a metabolite by comparing its abundance to that of a co-clustered standard i.e., AVA. However, in larger modules where abundances of metabolites span several orders of magnitude, there is a risk of losing metabolites that are bioactive at low concentrations. Finally, for microbial community-associated metabolomes, the current implementation cannot distinguish between host and microbial metabolites which could be incorporated in the future by leveraging associations with features in paired metagenomic datasets.

Although untargeted metabolomics is a powerful resource for the quantification of the metabolic activity in a phenotype or environment of interest, options for interpreting the many thousands of resulting, unidentified metabolic features remain limited. We developed MACARRoN to bridge the gap between untargeted metabolomics and downstream end goals such as bioprospecting, biomarker identification, and compound and enzyme characterization. All of these are particularly relevant in —although not unique to—the under-explored environment of microbial communities and the human microbiome. By integrating functional association, ecological, and phenotype-related information of metabolic features into a prioritization scheme, MACARRoN provides initial annotations for phenotype-linked metabolite features while simultaneously ranking them based on their potential bioactivity. This reduces the search space for actionable metabolites by several orders of magnitude. Using this approach, we identified several new metabolite classes and derivatives implicated in pro- or anti-inflammatory activity during IBD. We hope that future applications of the method will be able to illuminate the chemical dark matter which currently limits our understanding of complex phenotypes and environments.
