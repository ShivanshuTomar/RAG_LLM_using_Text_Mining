Colon, resulting in a significant reduction in inflammation in mice with DSS-induced chronic colitis (Vandenbroucke et al. 2010). A distinct class of immunoglobulins lacking light chains, referred to as nanobody (Nb) or VHHs (variable heavy chain), have been identified in shark and camel species (Verhaar et al. 2021). Their compact size (~ 15 kDa) confers enhanced tissue penetration capabilities. The intragastric administration of *Lactobacillus lactis* secreting interleukin-10 (IL-10) led to a substantial 50% reduction in colitis among DSS-treated mice and effectively prevented the onset of colitis in IL-10−/− mice (Steidler et al. 2000). Interleukin-10 (IL-10), a multifaceted cytokine, exerts diverse effects on cellular growth, differentiation, inflammation, and immune responses. It plays a crucial role in inflammation and immunosuppression and is recognized as an important factor in tumor development, infection control, organ transplantation, hematopoietic system regulation, and cardiovascular function (Moore et al. 2001). However, the majority of such studies focus on generating a single therapeutic protein using bacterial strains (Steidler et al. 2000; Vandenbroucke et al. 2010). This approach may lead to drug resistance and result in no significant therapeutic effect after long-term use of the drug (Roda et al. 2016). When compared with monotherapy, the combined administration of guselkumab and golimumab, targeting multiple biological pathways, demonstrated superior efficacy in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis (Feagan et al. 2023). Consequently, we chose anti-TNF-α nanobody and interleukin-10 (IL-10) as therapeutic proteins for the management of IBD.

E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) exhibits promising attributes, including facile genetic manipulation and probiotic characteristics, making it an ideal candidate for biotherapeutic applications. This non-pathogenic strain, serotype O6:K5:H1, exhibits antagonistic activities against various gut pathogens. Moreover, EcN engineering benefits from the availability of comprehensive molecular biology toolboxes (Kruis et al. 2004; Lynch et al. 2022; Sonnenborn 2016; Tan et al. 2020). Notably, EcN remains genetically stable and resistant to transformation by tox-phages found in enterohemorrhagic E. coli strains (Sonnenborn et al. 2009). Previous studies have demonstrated its production of defensins, cathelicidin, and calprotectin along with anti-inflammatory effects like inhibition of IL-6 and TNF-α (Choudhary et al. 2020; Grabig et al. 2006; Kai-Larsen et al. 2010; Wehkamp et al. 2004).

Here, we constructed two genetically engineered E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) strains capable of expressing and secreting anti-TNF-α nanobody and IL-10, respectively. The genetically modified bacteria effectively suppressed colonic inflammation induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), as demonstrated by reduced colon shortening, lower disease activity index, and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in colon tissues. More interestingly, architectural changes, inflammatory cell infiltrations, and epithelial injuries were reduced when treated with EcN-TNFaNb or/and EcN-IL10. Additionally, the administration of engineered bacteria did not induce gut fibrosis. Furthermore, the 16 S rRNA results verified that engineered bacteria could modulate the gut microbiome in DSS-induced IBD mice. Considering that the certain therapeutic efficacy achieved through the combination of two engineered bacteria, we foresee a promising future for engineered live bacterial therapeutics in treating IBD. This will promote the research and clinical application of novel drugs in this field.

# Materials and methods

# Bacterial strains and culture conditions

For plasmid construction and bacterial activation, the engineered bacteria (Supplemental Table S1) were cultured in lysogeny broth (LB) media with the respective antibiotics (50 μg/mL streptomycin or 50 μg/mL kanamycin) for 12 h at 37 °C.

# Gene cloning and soluble expression of anti‑TNF‑α nanobody and IL‑10 protein

We obtained the amino acid sequences of mouse anti-TNF-α nanobody and mouse IL-10 from literature reports (Vandenbroucke et al. 2010) and the NCBI website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), respectively (Supplemental Table S2). The respective DNA sequences were synthesized by Shanghai Ruimian Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (China) using PCR technology. Subsequently, the gene sequences for anti-TNF-α nanobody and IL-10, along with a sequence for a 6xHis tag, were inserted into the protein expression backbone vector pET-28a (www.snapgene.com/plasmids/pet_and_duet_vectors_(novagen)/pET-28a(%2B)). Next, the engineered plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21 individually to create IPTG (isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside)-inducible expression strains. The recombinant proteins were obtained following the previously described protocols (Zou et al. 2023). In short, after IPTG induction, the BL21 cells were collected from the cultures via centrifugation and then resuspended in PBS buffer, followed by ultrasonic cell disruption to obtain the product described as “whole protein.” Subsequently, the supernatant of the samples were collected through centrifugation and the purified products were obtained by purifying the supernatant using nickel columns (Smart Lifescience, Changzhou, China). Whole protein, supernatant, and purified products were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
