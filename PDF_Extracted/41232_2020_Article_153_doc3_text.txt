large amount of evidence in animal models [33, 35, 56–58] FMT (Fig. 2) on the benefits of probiotics, but little evidence in clinical trials for human disease. Additionally, studies on intake of probiotics without prebiotics is likely counterproductive; fortunately, in recent years, both probiotic and prebiotic treatments (symbiotics) have been tried. Kimchi, a type of Chinese cabbage (prebiotics), and lactic acid bacteria (probiotics) are examples of symbiotics [59]. Though often forgotten, it is important to note that in probiotic foods (such as yogurt) sold today in health stores, isolated bacteria are present, rather than human-derived bacteria. Gordon et al. demonstrated that mouse gut bacteria, rather than human-derived bacteria, termite-derived bacteria, and soil-derived bacteria, have the best colonization efficiency for the murine intestinal tract [60]. Naturally, probiotics derived from human feces are expected to be the most compatible with human gastrointestinal tracts and have a noticeable therapeutic effect in treatment strategies related to human health and diseases. Unfortunately, human-derived feces are not easily adapted for patients because of a general perception of uncleanliness.

Prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics each have specific associations with immune cells in the lamina propria. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands, which are present in food antigens, promote mucosal healing via IL-22 production from group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3). SFB also promote IL-22 production from ILC3 and activate lamina propria DCs and macrophages to induce Th17 cells through the production of SAA from IECs. C. rodentium and epithelial cell (EC)-adhesive bacteria induce Th17 differentiation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and others. C. butyricum induce intestinal IL-10-producing macrophages, while polysaccharide A (PSA)-positive B. fragilis stimulate DCs to produce IL-10. PSA itself directly promotes the development of the activation of Foxp3-positive Treg cells in a similar way to SCFA, such as propionate and butyrate. Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa also promote Treg cell accumulation via TGF-β production from IEC.
