Median values (inter-quartile ranges) are stated. Mann-Whitney U or Chi-squared test used to compare groups as appropriate. aIndicates Chi-squared test

Participants’ disease activity indices remained low after 8 weeks of exercise and no patient was removed from the trial due to a flare of symptoms. Two patients, one from each group, required oral antibiotics during the study for mild, intercurrent, non-IBD related infections (1 superficial skin infection and 1 lower respiratory tract infection). These incidents occurred at the midpoint of the study (weeks four and five).

There were no statistically significant changes in quality of life scores (SF36®V2, four physical and four mental health domains) or mood and anxiety scores (HADS, STAI, BDI-II) between the control and intervention groups after eight-weeks (data not shown).
