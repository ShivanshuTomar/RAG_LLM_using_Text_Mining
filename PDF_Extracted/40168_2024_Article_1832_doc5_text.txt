# Identification of IBD‑associated viral signatures

To determine the viral species associated with IBD, we conducted a case–control comparison of the vOTU composition in both the VLP and bulk viromes using the Wilcoxon rank‐sum test with Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment. This analysis identified a total of 139 vOTUs that displayed significant differences in relative abundances and consistent trends in case–control comparisons in both datasets (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Table 4); these vOTUs were designated IBD-associated gut viral signatures. Notably, a Fisher’s exact test analysis indicated a high level of agreement in the identification of differential vOTUs between the two datasets (odds ratio = 163; p < 0.001), signifying that these IBD-associated markers.

Fig. 3 Identification of IBD-associated vOTUs and exploration of their prokaryotic hosts and potential functions. a Scatter plot of q-values of vOTUs in the VLP and bulk datasets. Red and blue nodes represent the vOTUs that are significantly enriched in the viromes of IBD patients and healthy controls, respectively, with the same tendency in the VLP and bulk datasets. Statistical significance is determined using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment. b Distribution of the taxonomic annotation and host assignment of the IBD-enriched and control-enriched vOTUs. The vOTUs are grouped at the family level, and the prokaryotic host taxa are also shown at the family level. c Occurrence rates of 40 differential functions in IBD-enriched and control-enriched vOTUs. Red and blue nodes represent the IBD-enriched and control-enriched vOTUs, respectively. Statistical significance is determined using Fisher’s exact test with Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment, and a q < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
