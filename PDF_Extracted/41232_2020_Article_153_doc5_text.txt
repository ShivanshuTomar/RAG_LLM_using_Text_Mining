# Conclusion

In the near future, the mechanisms of symbiosis in various microorganisms that coexist in the intestinal environment, including intestinal microbiota, will be clarified. Future medical practice may use bacteriotherapy, which is independent of a fecal bank and applies more refined microbiota. Additionally, molecules produced by microbiota genes may appear as pharmaceuticals. At present, it is desirable to use bacteriotherapy for a group of life-threatening diseases, such as rCDI. However, for patients with non-fatal and intractable diseases, the bacteriotherapy could be challenged because of lack of its safety evidence. A future of bacteriotherapy that is in harmony with the development of various drugs is desired.

# Authors’ information

YY is a board-certified internal medicine physician and gastroenterologist. He has graduated from Keio University School of Medicine and received M.D., followed by completing residency in internal medicine and in gastroenterology and hepatology. He is currently a Ph.D. student in the IBD research fellow program under supervision of Dr. Takanori Kanai at Keio University. He is interested in the unknown pathogenic mechanism of IBD and trying to develop novel treatment strategies against IBD. Now, he is working on a project that deciphers complex immune networks in intestinal mucosal immunity and elucidates mechanisms how the Chinese herbal medicine shows therapeutic effects on patients with ulcerative colitis. He wishes to develop safe and effective IBD treatments.

YM completed graduate school and residency training in internal medicine and in gastroenterology and hepatology at Keio University School of Medicine, in Tokyo, Japan. He studied mucosal immunology in inflammatory bowel diseases during his Ph.D. work in the laboratory of Drs. Toshifumi Hibi and Takanori Kanai. He received his postdoctoral training in the laboratory of Dr. John O’Shea at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS/NIH), studying genomic and epigenomic mechanisms that regulate innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. His research goal is understanding unappreciated molecular mechanisms that regulate homeostasis, inflammation, wound healing, and fibrosis in the intestine, as well as identifying new therapeutic approaches for inflammatory bowel diseases.
