that Streptococcus genus infection is associated with reactive arthritis [40], although it is not HLA-B27-associated, and it appears not to be a form of spondyloarthritis. It follows that despite the divergence of the AS and IBD microbiomes, a small number of pathogenic genera may be the shared/common factors initially triggering disease. However, further species- and strain-level characterisation, enabled by whole genome sequencing, is required to properly determine whether the enriched taxa are in fact pathogenic. Other than these, several genera were also depleted in IBD patients and in IBD patients with elevated FCP. These genera included Actinomyces, Rothia, and Lachnospira, a genus within each of the Carnobacteriaceae and Ruminococcaceae families.

The use of 16S sequencing in the current study not only limited the taxonomic depth from which conclusions were drawn, but it also prevented a suitable measurement of the functional/metabolic capabilities of the microbiome. Multi-omic, systems biology, approaches (incorporating shotgun metagenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics) are increasingly being used to comprehensively interrogate the microbial features associated with disease. Adopting these approaches in future is essential to move beyond the broad correlations noted in 16S sequencing studies and towards identification of precise microbial features and their causative impacts.

In conclusion, consistent with immunological and genetic evidence, the distinct microbiomes of AS and IBD patients indicate that the gut plays a different role in driving disease. However, enrichment of specific pathogenic genera indicates that the presence of shared/common microbial trigger of disease cannot be discounted. Further research utilising contemporary approaches is required to expand upon these initial observations and to identify precisely the microbial features driving different types of disease.
