Indirectness, and potential publication bias. The overall certainty of the evidence was rated as 'high,' 'moderate,' 'low,' or 'very low.' We presented the results of the GRADE evaluation in summary of findings tables for all primary outcomes (i.e. induction and maintenance of remission and serious adverse events) and the following secondary outcomes: any adverse events, induction of endoscopic remission, and quality of life. We reported the GRADE evaluations separately for use of FMT for induction of remission in UC, maintenance of remission in UC, induction of remission in CD, and maintenance of remission in CD at longest follow-up, along with the follow-up time ranges.

In the previous version of this review (Imdad 2018), a search conducted on 19 March 2018 identified 1020 studies, and after removal of duplicates, 665 studies were retained for the title and abstract screening. Out of 34 studies reviewed by full-text, eight reports of four studies were included (Costello 2019; Moayyedi 2015; Paramsothy 2017; Rossen 2015), of which one was an abstract version of what has subsequently become a full-length paper (Costello 2019). That search identified 13 ongoing studies. For this updated version of the review, we included the four full studies from the previous review (Figure 1).
