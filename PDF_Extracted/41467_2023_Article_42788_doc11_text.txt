In addition, previous studies have shown that differences in gut bacteria or metabolites found in different case-control studies mostly indicate a general imbalance in the gut ecosystem50, rather than specific changes linked to certain diseases. This highlights the difficulty in identifying distinct patterns of gut bacteria or metabolites that are specific to particular diseases. In our present study, we successfully formulated disease-specific signatures that exhibited a low false positive rate across gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, such as adenoma and colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as non-GI diseases like diabetes. In summary, this multi-omics model can propel innovations in both clinical practice and the realm of medical science.

While unresolved causality among microbial, metabolite, and host processes during IBD development is not a primary focus for diagnostic purposes, elucidating the underlying mechanisms would significantly enhance our understanding of this disease. To achieve this objective, we have developed comprehensive workflows for both functional metagenome and metabolome analysis. Firstly, through the analysis of functional gene (KO genes) within the gut microbiota, we identified multiple regulatory pathways associated with disease development involving the gut microbiota. Notably, the Two-component systems, composed of sensor histidine kinases and response regulator proteins, play a crucial role in bacterial and archaeal signal transduction processes34. Additionally, we discovered a key transcriptional regulatory factor enriched in this pathway, known as crp (Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein). crp belongs to the CRP-FNR superfamily of transcription factors and is activated as a DNA-binding protein by binding with its allosteric effector, cAMP51. The regulation of the Two-component system or crp holds promise as a therapeutic target for treating IBD. Through MOBC maps, our research has uncovered a significant enrichment in the Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) play a vital role as catalysts in protein synthesis across all living organisms. However, their functions have evolved over time, and a growing body of research indicates that their non-classical functions might hold even greater importance46–49,52. The diverse functionality of ARSs has revealed their potential as a valuable and underutilized resource for therapeutic targets in IBD.

Of course, our study does have some limitations. Being a cross-cohort study, it’s difficult to completely eliminate biases in areas like selecting cohorts, collecting samples, and analyzing methods. However, we’ve taken extensive measures to minimize these factors, ensuring the study’s scientific rigor. Still, there could be unknown factors influencing the results, such as diet, medication, and lifestyle choices, which require further investigation for validation.

In conclusion, our study revealed the overall patterns of changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome of IBD patients using CCIA. This information can be valuable for exploring interventions and treatments for IBD. Further research should validate and delve deeper into the underlying molecular mechanisms, such as longitudinal studies and interventions. While microbiota and metabolite interventions hold promise for managing health conditions, they also come with challenges and ethical considerations that need careful evaluation, for example, microbiota variation, long-term effects, and standardization need thorough attention. Longitudinal studies are crucial to fully understand how the gut microbiota and metabolome change during different stages of IBD and in response to interventions.

# Methods

# Ethics statement

The patient cohorts were approved by the ethics committee of Renji Hospital affiliated to the School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, the ethical approval number are 2019-qkwkt-001 and 2021-skt-004. In this study, we did not have any specific requirements regarding the participants’ gender, and the gender of participants was determined based on self-report. All participants provided informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.

# Participants enrollment

In this study, we recruited two IBD cohorts from Renji Hospital, Shanghai, including the Puxi and Pudong campuses, for the discovery and validation cohorts, between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2022, respectively. We also recruited a group of healthy control subjects who were carefully matched by age and gender across two hospital campuses. It should be noted that all participants who were enrolled provided informed consent. The enrollment was followed the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, which are provided in the follow.

The inclusion criteria included: (1) Participants must be aged between 16 and 65 to be eligible. (2) IBD group were patients newly diagnosed with UC or CD by combining clinical symptoms, imaging, endoscopic and pathological appearances, and had not received any treatment the time of enrollment; (3) Control group was a healthy control population that did not have any significant abnormality in colonoscopy; (4) the participants were capable of understanding and completing the questionnaire, and were willing to cooperate in the collection of fecal samples and basic and clinical information. The exclusion criteria include: (1) medication history of antibiotics, probiotics, immunosuppressants, hormone, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs within three months before enrollment; (2) abdominal surgery history within six months before enrollment; (3) history of cancer, other autoimmune disease excluding IBD, organ transplantation, or other serious digestive diseases; (4) uncontrolled systemic metabolic disorders such as blood pressure, blood glucose, blood lipids within six months before enrollment; (5) severe and uncontrolled gastrointestinal symptoms such as severe gastrointestinal bleeding, severe diarrhea, severe constipation, gastrointestinal obstruction, etc., within six months before enrollment; (6) significant changes in dietary habits, such as the initiation of a vegan diet, etc., within six months before enrollment; (7) inability to cooperate or unwillingness to cooperate with this study.

# Metagenomic cohorts

In the metagenomic cohorts (Fig. 2a), a total of 208 participants were enrolled, comprising 138 patients diagnosed with IBD and 70 healthy control subjects, matched for age and gender. Specifically, the Puxi cohort (N = 132, control=45, IBD = 87) and the Pudong cohort (N = 76, control=25, IBD = 51) were employed for both model discovery and validation purposes. For the metabolomic cohorts (Fig. 4a), a total of 178 participants were included, with 135 individuals diagnosed with IBD and 43 healthy control subjects, carefully matched for age and gender. Among these, the Puxi cohort (N = 108, control=25, IBD = 83) and the Pudong cohort (N = 70, control=18, IBD = 52) were utilized for both model discovery and validation phases. In the combined analysis cohorts (Fig. 5a), a total of 171 participants were incorporated, consisting of 130 patients with IBD and 41 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. Among them, the Puxi cohort (N = 104, control=24, IBD = 80) and the Pudong cohort (N = 67, control=17, IBD = 50) were utilized for both model discovery and validation stages. The details of recruitment for the in-house IBD Renji cohorts are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a. The clinical characteristics of the study participants are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

# Public cohorts of patients with IBD and normal controls

The metagenomic raw sequencing data for the FranzosaEA 2019A and FranzosaEA 2019B cohorts (PRJNA400072), and HeQ 2017 (PRJEB15371) were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive. In addition, the metagenomic sequencing data for the HallAB 2017 cohort (PRJNA385949), NielsenHB 2014 cohort (PRJEB1220), HMP 2019 ibdmdb cohort (PRJNA398089) and the LifeLD VilaAV 2018 cohort (EGAS00001001704, EGAD00001004194) data were acquired from the curatedMetagenomicData. The two published metabolomics cohorts were obtained from a previously published study10 and contained pre-processed data. All metadata for both metagenomics and
