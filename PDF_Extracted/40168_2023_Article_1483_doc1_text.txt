# Introduction

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are debilitating chronic illnesses of the intestinal tract, thought to occur in genetically predisposed individuals who are exposed to microbial, dietary, and environmental triggers [1]. While eukaryotic viruses play a role in shaping mucosal immunity and homeostasis without causing pathology in healthy subjects [2], they can contribute to the development of IBD in genetically predisposed subjects by disturbing biophysical integrity of the bowel, altering the microbiome, provoking loss of tolerance to gut microbiota, and promoting chronic inflammation [1, 3]. The microbial complexity of IBD is illustrated in metagenomic surveys of whole colon RNA samples, where increased expression of common viruses is associated with bacterial dysbiosis and an increased expression of endogenous retrovirus RNA, which effectively lowers the threshold for triggering inflammation through innate immune pathways [4]. However, studies of viral infection in IBD patients are limited by the difficulty in discerning a cause-and-effect relationship, differentiating passenger viruses from causal agents, and often do not account for the effects of specific IBD risk alleles.

Central to a viral hypothesis is that IBD is restricted to genetically susceptible individuals and involves alterations in the gut microbiome. Indeed, the genetic predisposition and pathogenesis of Crohn disease (CD) are intertwined with downregulation of innate immunity and autophagy pathways employed for handling of intracellular bacteria [5]. The superimposed role of viral infection in the IBD process is exemplified in “virus + susceptibility gene” animal models. For example, murine norovirus infection in the mutated ATL16L1 mouse model triggers both enteritis and dysbiosis that is treatable by antibiotics [3]. The clinical relevance of this model is underscored by reports that Norovirus infection mediates a critical loss of cytoprotective effect of Paneth cells leading to a CD-like pathology [6], and infection with Norovirus may often precede the development of CD in population studies [7].

Both viral infection and candidate IBD susceptibility variants may also serve a conjoint effect of facilitating immunodeficiency that perturbs intestinal barrier function. Several retroviruses including HIV [8], simian immunodeficiency virus [9], feline leukemia virus [10], and murine leukemia virus [11] have all been linked with colitis with disruption of mucosal barrier function and dysregulation of immune responses to commensal microbes. Notably, human endogenous retroviral RNA is often overexpressed in inflammatory disease leading to activation of innate immune responses, but these agents do not emerge from the genome to make transmissible, exogenous viral particles [4]. In contrast, inbred laboratory mice have been selected to develop disease, and as a result, genetically manipulated immunodeficient mice can resurrect endogenous retroviral sequences from the genome to create infectious transmissible particles that cause pathology [12].

We have studied this process and identified evidence of Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) infection in several genetically modified mice [13]. MMTV is the causal agent of murine breast cancer and has been linked with autoimmune biliary disease and murine rheumatoid arthritis in genetically manipulated models [13, 14]. MMTV is a murine Betaretrovirus endogenously encoded in the genome of most laboratory mice. Some mice express transmissible Betaretrovirus particles in a strain-dependant fashion and develop breast cancer, whereas other mice do not develop productive infection due to modifications that inactivate replication competence of the endogenous mtv loci [14–16]. Furthermore, strains such as C57BL/6 have developed resistance to MMTV, but infection may emerge following genetic manipulation of immune function [13]. Indeed, some of the MMTV expressing mice also serve as models for IBD, such as T-cell TGF-β receptor II dominant-negative mouse and the IL-2 receptor α-deficient mouse [13]. The natural biology of MMTV is germane to the pathophysiology of IBD. Neonatal infection in mouse milk occurs prior to the acidification of the stomach, and virus is efficiently transmitted through mucosal surfaces by binding bacterial lipopolysaccharide and engagement of the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) [14, 17]. This in turn leads to the production of interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (IL-10−/−) to tolerize the host to viral infection. A robust immune response is triggered in Peyer’s patches by the MMTV-encoded viral superantigen (vSAG) to enable viral replication in proliferating lymphocytes [14]. The infected lymphocytes are trafficked to the mammary gland epithelium where MMTV is maximally expressed following pregnancy.

One commonly utilized research model of IBD is the IL-10−/− mouse model of colitis, which not only resembles IBD but also responds to existing therapeutic options [18]. IL-10−/− mice develop colitis shortly after weaning, which is highly dependent upon the environment the mice are raised in and the composition of their gut microbiome [19]. While evaluating different mouse models for evidence of MMTV [13], we incidentally found increased levels of MMTV RNA in tissues from the IL-10−/− colitis model as compared to the 129 SvEv wild-type (WT) mice. The viral biology of MMTV may be relevant in the IL-10−/− colitis model because pups cross fostered with wild-type mothers are protected from developing disease [20]. Furthermore, MMTV requires interaction with mucosal commensal bacteria to utilize the TLR-4 and IL-10-dependant mechanism for uptake.
