QIIME2 platform17,18. The number of observed Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) was used as a measure of absolute species diversity across the four study cohorts24. All IBD patients had significantly less observed species diversity than healthy controls (Healthy = 320 ASVs vs IBD = 290 ASVs, p = 0.0276, Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2).

When stratifying patients by IBD condition, results followed a commonly reported pattern with CD patients having significantly less observed diversity (ASVs = 248) than both UC patients (ASVs = 319) and healthy controls (ASVs = 320) (p < 0.05 in all cases, Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 3). Notably, UC patients had similar observed diversity to that of healthy controls (Healthy = 320 ASVs vs UC = 319 ASVs), but the average observed diversity of the gut microbiome of MC patients (ASVS = 259) was similar to that of CD patients (ASVs = 248). To assess whether observed diversity reflected a change in phylogenetic diversity, we used the Faith PD measure25. Results widely followed the pattern reported for Observed ASVs with fewer species leading to less phylogenetic diversity (Supplementary Figure 11). IBD patients had a significantly less phylogenetically diverse microbiome than healthy controls (p = 0.0459). When stratifying by IBD condition, CD patients had significantly less phylogenetic diversity in their microbiomes than both healthy controls and UC patients (p < 0.05 in all cases, Supplementary Table 4). Whereas MC patients and CD patients had microbiomes with similar levels of phylogenetic diversity.

We next investigated how changes in alpha diversity were reflected in similarity of taxonomic composition changes between IBD conditions using the Brayâ€“Curtis dissimilarity measure (Fig. 1). There were significant differences in the taxonomic composition of the microbiome between healthy controls, CD, UC, and MC patients (PERMANOVA, R2 = 0.02845, p < 0.001). Furthermore, pairwise comparison demonstrated both CD and UC patients had significantly different taxonomic compositions relative to healthy controls and that UC and CD patients had significantly different taxonomic compositions from one another (PERMANOVA, p < 0.01, Supplementary Table 5).

# The impact of disease location on the microbiome.

To understand how disease location influenced the microbiome, we stratified patients according to where CD or UC presented. Not enough patients were recruited for MC to do this, owing to the rarity of the condition. For patients with CD, there were significant differences in measures of alpha diversity according to where the disease presented (p < 0.001 in all cases, Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). CD-CC and CD-SB, was associated with significantly lower level of observed (229 and 230 ASVs for CD-CC and CD-SB respectively) and phylogenetic diversity (16.67 Faith PD, 16.88 Faith PD for CD-CC and CD-SB respectively) than CD-TI (309 ASVs, 21 Faith PD, p < 0.05 in all cases), with CD-TI indistinguishable in diversity measures from healthy controls. These differences were also reflected in composition analysis; patients with CD-TI did not have a significantly different taxonomic composition to healthy controls, however, patients with CD-CC and CD-SB did have significantly different taxonomic compositions compared to healthy controls (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 8).

Unlike CD, when investigating disease location for UC, none of the UC locations were significantly different in microbiome diversity or composition from one another, or from that of the healthy controls (Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables 8, 9 and 10). When comparing CD-TI, CD-CC, and CD-SB, with the different locations of UC, CD groups that were significantly different from healthy controls (CD-CC and CD-SB) were also significantly different in composition from multiple UC locations (Fig. 1E, Supplementary Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 1D).

We next investigated the influence that disease severity had on the microbiome. No significant difference was observed between those patients with prior surgery (e.g., resection) and those without, though this may be due to the limited number of patients who had a history of surgery. This was both at the individual disease level (e.g., CD, UC, or MC) as well as the higher disease classification level of IBD. The current cohort had an over-representation of patients with mild disease and only a limited number of patients with moderate or severe disease. When stratifying CD patients by severity, for CD there were only two reported cases of moderate disease and no cases of severe disease. Across CD patients there was no significant differences in Faith or Observed ASV diversity across our patient cohort (Observed ASV diversity Kruskal Wallis Chi Square = 1.7866 p = 0.4093, Faith PD Kruskal Wallis Chi Square = 1.585, p = 0.4557). Clearly, more patients of a higher disease severity are needed to elucidate the interplay between disease severity and the microbiome in CD patients. However, these finding do confirm that the results observed for disease location is not due to a confounding issue of disease severity. Mirroring the CD cohort, for UC patients, there was no significant relationship between the microbiome and severity of disease for this cohort (Observed ASV diversity Kruskal Wallis Chi Square = 3.6606, p = 0.4539, Faith PD Kruskal Wallis Chi Square = 4.6736, p = 0.3225), however, further work is needed with more representation from moderate and severe disease to elucidate the relationship between the microbiome and IBD disease severity levels.

# Different IBD conditions and locations have different taxonomic markers.

Previous studies have highlighted a decrease in the families Lachnospiraceae anaerobes such as the Proteobacteria are increased compared to healthy controls5,7,26,27. Across IBD conditions, and Ruminococcaceae during IBD whereas facultative microbial imbalances have been observed at multiple different taxonomic levels with many groups of bacteria co-occurring across patients 28. Using the tool LEfSe22, we determined which microbial groups most likely explained the observed differences in microbiome composition.

When comparing the microbiome of CD patients to healthy controls there was a significant decrease in the abundance of several key phyla such as the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Tenericutes, and Firmicutes (LDA (log10) > 2.0, p < 0.05 in all cases, Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 12) as has been reported in prior studies 19. In particular, the genera Faecalibacterium, Alistipes, Eubacterium and Ruminococcus were significantly decreased in CD patients relative to healthy controls demonstrating a reduction in obligate anaerobes. Furthermore, there was a
