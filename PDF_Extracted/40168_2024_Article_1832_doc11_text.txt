and other Enterobacteriaceae phages has also been observed in mucosal viromes of UC patients [53]. Streptococcus and Veillonella are commensal bacteria in the gut that have proinflammatory properties and are associated with diseases such as cirrhosis and obesity [54]. Although Streptococcus phages have been reported to be associated with metabolic and autoimmune diseases [55], their role in IBD has not been reported. In addition, our results showed that IBD-enriched vOTUs were more frequently associated with IBD-related pathogenic bacteria as their hosts, suggesting their involvement in the development of IBD through their prokaryotic hosts, as observed in immune diseases [10, 56]. Regarding IBD-depleted viruses, crAss-like and Quimbyviridae are newly identified viral clades that tend to infect Bacteroidetes, which are major polysaccharide degraders in the gut [57]. Similarly, at the vOTU level, numerous unclassified control-enriched vOTUs are predicted to infect Bacteroidetes, particularly Prevotella species, which are known to widely participate in plant polysaccharide utilization [58]. Studies have shown that these two clades of viruses, crAss-like and Quimbyviridae, have larger genomes and a substantial number of functional auxiliary genes, especially carbohydrate-active enzymes involved in polysaccharide metabolism [59, 60]. Therefore, the decrease in crAss-like and Quimbyviridae viruses and Prevotella phages may imply the loss of certain core viral functions, such as polysaccharide metabolism, in the gut virome of IBD patients.

# Universality and disease relevance of the IBD‑associated viral signatures

Recent meta-analyses of the gut virome in colorectal cancer patients have revealed distinctive viral signatures among diverse populations and suggested that their virome characteristics may operate independently from the bacteriome [8]. Similarly, by studying fecal samples from populations spanning Europe, the USA, Israel, and China, we found that despite population heterogeneity and differences in sample treatment methods, most of the IBD-associated viral signatures identified in our current study could be validated in other datasets. This indicates that our dataset and analyses effectively captured the universal signal characteristics in the IBD virome. The consistency of gut viral signatures in transcontinental datasets may not only be correlated with common changes in the bacterial microbiome but also suggest that some viruses can independently influence IBD in a consistent manner across geographic populations, potentially through mechanisms such as immunoregulation or viral infection [61]. Furthermore, we discovered that the classifying models with only 33 viral markers could effectively distinguish between the IBD and control groups in nearly all datasets (average AUC > 0.80), suggesting their potential diagnostic value for IBD and relevant diseases.

Previous animal experiments have confirmed that FVT from UC patients can exacerbate the severity of DSS-induced colitis [23]. Here, we performed a similar FVT experiment by transplanting VLPs from IBD patients and healthy controls into an HMA mouse model of experimental colitis. Surprisingly, we observed that IBD-associated viruses (both IBD-enriched and control-enriched viruses) could colonize the mice at very high levels after FVT, with an average relative abundance exceeding 50% and more than 200 times the number compared to bacteria. Accompanying the colonization of IBD-associated viruses, mice exhibited significant changes in colitis, pathological injury, and intestinal permeability. Isolation and direct functional investigation of these IBD-associated viruses may be needed to address causality between the gut virome and IBD progression in future research. Importantly, in contrast to previous studies focusing on the exacerbation of disease by IBD-FVT, our research found that HC-FVT effectively improved intestinal permeability and inflammatory markers in mice with colitis. This finding suggests the potential of HC-FVT as a therapeutic approach for the IBD population.

Furthermore, we also found that compared with mice with IBD-FMT, mice with HC-FMT exhibited an alleviated IBD phenotype. The improvement derived from the HC-FMT was comparable to that of the HC-FVT. It would be interesting to differentiate the contributions of FMT and FVT to IBD treatment. However, this was impossible in the present study because the mice received FMT and FVT simultaneously. The use of an antibiotic cocktail before the establishment of an HMA mouse model is another point that requires attention. Broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens can induce a 10,000-fold reduction in the gut bacterial load, leading to a significant increase in the diversity and relative abundance of the gut fungal microbiota, and a decrease in gut virome diversity [3, 62, 63]. Additional studies using germ-free mice or clinical trials may be needed to further clarify the role of FVT in IBD progression in the future.

In discussing the limitations of our study, it is important to acknowledge that while we made efforts to ensure age, sex, and BMI matching between the control and disease groups during sample collection, and established strict exclusion criteria such as excluding individuals with liver diseases, kidney diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, and cancers, there are potential confounding factors related to participants’ income levels, dietary habits, exercise patterns, and lifestyles. These differences among subjects may have influenced the study outcomes. Therefore, we advocate that future research exercise greater caution in selecting control groups, striving to align demographic.
