# Study name

Fecal microbial transplantation and vedolizumab treatment of Crohn's disease

# Methods

RCT conducted in Israel

# Participants

# Inclusion criteria

- Mild-to-moderately active disease determined by the HBI of 5 to ≤ 15
- Eligibility to commence treatment with vedolizumab (screened for tuberculosis and hepatitis B, without active infection or abscess)

# Exclusion criteria

- CD in remission (HBI < 5) or with severe disease (HBI > 16)
- Presence of stoma
- Hospitalization
- Any ongoing or planned antibiotic therapy
- Active intestinal infection – positive stool culture or Clostridioides difficile infection
- Severe disease (e.g. malignant disease; hepatic failure; renal failure; cardiovascular, metabolic, neurologic disease)
- Pregnancy or lactation
- Severe food allergies
- Inability to sign informed consent or complete study protocol

# Interventions

# Experimental arm

- Capsules of fecal matter solution (feces from healthy donor, glycerol, and saline solution)

# Control arm

- Placebo capsules of glycerol and saline

# Outcomes

# Primary outcomes

- Safety of FMT before vedolizumab treatment in participants with CD (measured by disease exacerbations, hospitalizations, and surgery rate in treatment vs placebo group) at weeks 14 and 46
- Efficacy of FMT before vedolizumab treatment in participants with CD that results in higher remission rate at weeks 14 and 46

# Secondary outcomes

- Efficacy of FMT before vedolizumab treatment in participants with CD that results in:
- clinical response rate at weeks 14, 22, and 46
- endoscopic response at week 46
- endoscopic remission at week 46
- histologic healing at week 46
- biologic remission at weeks 14, 22, and 46
- Safety of FMT before vedolizumab treatment in participants with CD that results in low adverse events rate at week 46
