This pattern was consistent with the family-level viral profile (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Almost all families exhibited significantly different relative abundances between various samples obtained from the two technologies, especially in the case of two predominant families, Microviridae (average relative abundance 13.5% vs. 1.4% in VLP and bulk viromes, respectively, Wilcoxon rank-sum test q = 2.5 × 10 –11) and Myoviridae (1.8% vs. 7.8%, q = 1.6 × 10–16) (Fig. 1d). Notably, of the 401 Microviridae vOTUs present in the VLP metagenomes, only 61.8% (248/401) had reads captured by the bulk metagenomic samples (Supplementary Fig. 1b). These results concur with prior studies highlighting the substantial differences between VLPs and bulk technologies in virome capture and profiling [26, 30], emphasizing the need to integrate both methods to comprehensively study entire gut viral communities.

# Eukaryotic and prokaryotic virome diversity in IBD patients and healthy subjects

To gauge the gut virome diversity concerning IBD, we conducted a comparative analysis of the observed index (reflecting viral richness) and Shannon index (representing viral diversity) within the viromes of IBD patients and healthy controls. The examination was carried out separately for eukaryotic and prokaryotic viromes due to disparities in the results obtained (as elaborated below). In the eukaryotic virome, we observed a significant increase in both the observed and Shannon indices for IBD patients in comparison to healthy controls. This pattern held true for both the VLP and bulk metagenomic datasets (Fig. 2a). The elevation in eukaryotic viruses, which can infect host cells in the gut, aligns with earlier research suggesting that the heightened presence of eukaryotic viruses may serve as a hallmark in IBD patients, particularly those with UC [20]. In contrast, when considering the prokaryotic virome, we observed that diversity indices (especially the Shannon index) were greater in IBD patients than in healthy controls in the VLP dataset. However, a reversal of this trend was observed in the bulk dataset, where the indices were significantly lower in IBD patients than in controls (Fig. 2b). This discrepancy may stem from the preference of the VLP technique for free viral particles, which tends to increase in IBD patients. In contrast, bulk metagenomes predominantly capture actively infecting viruses or integrated prophages [30], and these are diminished in IBD patients along with some bacteria. As a corroborative point, we found that gut bacteriome diversity significantly decreased in IBD patients in comparison to controls. Importantly, this bacteriome diversity exhibited a stronger positive correlation with the prokaryotic virome diversity in the bulk dataset than in the VLP dataset (Supplementary Fig. 2).

# Gut virome structure associated with IBD

PCoA analysis of the gut virome structure indicated a clear demarcation between IBD patients and healthy subjects, irrespective of whether VLP or bulk viromes were considered (Fig. 2c), underscoring a profound alteration in the viromes of IBD patients. Intriguingly, no significant difference was noted between the gut viromes of CD and UC patients in the PCoA plot. In contrast to IBD-control differentiation, which accounted for 1.9% (PERMANOVA p < 0.001) and 7.2% (p < 0.001) of the gut virome variance in the VLP and bulk datasets, respectively, the effect of CD-UC differentiation was substantially lower at 0.8% (PERMANOVA p = 0.513) and 1.7% (p = 0.029). Furthermore, demographic parameters such as age, sex, BMI, and disease activity had minimal impacts on gut virome variance (effect size < 0.5%, PERMANOVA p > 0.05 for all parameters).

Given the similarity in gut virome diversity and structure between CD patients and UC patients, we proceeded with a case–control comparison of the gut viral profiles for all IBD patients against those of healthy controls. This analysis focused on the 20 most abundant viral families, representing 99.7% of the total relative abundance of known viral families in both the VLP and bulk viromes. The results revealed that 11 out of the 20 viral families in the VLP metagenomes displayed trends of change consistent with those observed in the bulk metagenomes (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Table 3). Among these viral families, Siphoviridae, the predominant viral family in the human gut, displayed a mean relative abundance that was 250% greater (Wilcoxon rank-sum test q = 4.0 × 10 –5) in the VLP dataset and 89% greater (q = 6.2 × 10–4) in the bulk dataset of IBD patients compared to controls. However, in the IBD gut virome, Myoviridae and Salasmaviridae were significantly enriched in the VLP dataset but not in the bulk dataset, while Podoviridae and Inoviridae were enriched in the bulk dataset but not in the VLP dataset. In contrast, crAss-like and Quimbyviridae viruses experienced a significant reduction in relative abundance in both datasets of IBD patients. Reduction in Microviridae, Adenoviridae, Gratiaviridae, and Autographiviridae was exclusively observed in the VLP dataset and not in the bulk dataset. Anelloviridae exhibited conspicuous enrichment among IBD patients in the VLP dataset but a marked reduction in the bulk dataset, whereas Inoviridae exhibited the opposite trend. (Fig. 2d). At the vOTU level, almost all Anelloviridae vOTUs demonstrated increased relative abundance in IBD patients, regardless of whether they were detected in the VLP or bulk datasets (Supplementary Fig. 3). Furthermore, consistent with prior studies [5, 21], it is noteworthy that the relative abundance of Caudovirales (primarily composed of Siphoviridae and Myoviridae) significantly increased in IBD patients.
