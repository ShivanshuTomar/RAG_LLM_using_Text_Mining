Given the pivotal role played by salt in the human diet, the influence of sodium consumption on human health is being increasingly highlighted, particularly in the context of disease risk. A recent statistical analysis of dietary trends in China revealed that a diet high in salt, and particularly sodium, has become a prevalent feature of the country’s dietary habits. The World Health Organization (WHO) Healthy Diet Fact Sheet recommends a daily intake of less than 5 g of salt. Nevertheless, despite a reduction in sodium intake in China from 6.3 g/d in 1991 to 4.1 g/d in 2015, the level remains double the tolerated upper limit suggested by the WHO. This high-salt-intake dietary pattern, which is becoming increasingly common, has the potential to negatively impact the health and well-being of the Chinese people. Moreover, over the past few decades, most Americans have consumed sodium more than the recommended levels, which are less than 2.3 g/day according to the American Heart Association’s recommendation. The average American consumes 3.4 g of sodium (or 8.5 g of salt) each day, which is much more than the recommended amounts, according to data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These results indicate that excessive salt intake is a prevalent phenomenon in numerous countries. Given the intimate connection between diet and our lives, the potential dangers of a high-salt diet are often overlooked. It is, therefore, crucial to conduct research and gain a deeper understanding of the risks associated with a high-salt diet, in order to provide individuals with comprehensive and evidence-based nutritional and dietary guidance. Furthermore, given the established link between diet and gut microbiology, with implications for disease development, several recent studies have explored the impact of a high salt intake on gut microbiology and disease, including inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular disease. These studies serve to illustrate that a diet high in salt can exert a detrimental effect on the gut microflora, which, in turn, can impair gut health and thereby contribute to the etiology and progression of a number of diseases.

# 2. Dietary Salt’s Effect on the Gut Microbiota

# 2.1. Gut Microbiota and Immune System

The gut microbiota and intestinal immune system interact dynamically, and dietary salt can influence this interaction, meaning it can affect intestine immunity. In the gut microbiota, some beneficial bacteria have been shown to inhibit host immune cells, such as Lactobacillales, Clostridium sensu stricto, Prevotella, and Alloprevotella. Additionally, certain harmful bacteria have the capacity to induce the production of inflammatory cytokines in the intestinal tract through interactions with immune cells or the action of their metabolites, thereby contributing to the development of intestinal damage, such as Escherichia coli and Prevotellaceae, which have been linked to metabolic syndrome and chronic inflammation. In addition, some conditionally pathogenic microbiota can be considered as symbiotic under normal conditions; however, in instances of inflammation or overgrowth, they may exert a deleterious influence on gut health. For example, Bacteroides, Candida, Alistipes, and Anaerotruncus. It is, therefore, essential to maintain a balance between beneficial and harmful bacteria to maintain immune homeostasis and reduce inflammatory responses in the gut.

These intestinal microorganisms exert their effects on the gut and systemic immunity by the means of the metabolites they produce, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), indole, and bile acid (BA) metabolites, thus maintaining the gut and systemic homeostasis. Normal gut microbiota conditions allow for the secretion of these compounds, which inhibit.
