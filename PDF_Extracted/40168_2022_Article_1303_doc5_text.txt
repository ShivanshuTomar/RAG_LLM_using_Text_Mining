# Colonic microbiota and metabolites undergo dramatic remodelling between control and diseased individuals in both two pig breeds

Intrigued by the results of the phenotypic characterisation, we next sought to determine the bacterial composition of the microbiota in control and diseased individuals of the two pig breeds to elucidate any compositional differences. We calculated α-diversity using the richness and Shannon indices as a measure of species diversity across the samples. α-diversity did not differ between Y-CON and Y-DSS pigs but was slightly lower (although still high) in M-DSS pigs than in M-CON pigs. Compared with control pigs, pigs with DSS-induced colitis showed significant differences in β-diversity, a measure of compositional similarity, as measured by unweighted UniFrac distances. It is known that pigs with DSS-induced colitis could alter the gut microbiota, and our findings further supported significant changes in bacterial composition in M-DSS and Y-DSS pigs.

To further understand the microbial dissimilarities between control and diseased individuals of the two breeds, we evaluated the taxonomic composition of the colonic microbiota. The clusters of samples that significantly separated the microbiota according to breed and treatment are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. M-CON pigs had a diverse community of different bacterial phyla in the colon, whereas M-DSS pigs displayed an increase in Firmicutes and major reductions in Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes. A detailed investigation of the families belonging to Firmicutes revealed increases in Rumino-coccaceae, Christensenellaceae and Lactobacillaceae in the colons of M-DSS pigs. Among families belonging to Bacteroidetes, Prevotellaceae and Muribaculaceae decreased, while Bacteroidaceae increased. Different results were obtained for Yorkshire pigs. At the phylum level, Y-DSS pigs displayed a reduction in Firmicutes and increases in Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes compared with Y-CON pigs. The decreased abundance of Firmicutes included a wide range of families, including Lachnospiraceae, Christensenellaceae and Lactobacillaceae, and the increased abundance of Bacteroidetes was represented by increases in the families Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae.

To identify specific bacterial genera that were characteristic of the two breeds, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEFSe) was used to evaluate further the differences in bacterial composition between animals. In our study, differential abundance tests identified similarities in the dysbiosis patterns of the Min pigs and Yorkshire pigs. Our data indicated that Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio and Streptococcus, which were associated with intestinal inflammation, were enriched in diseased individuals of two breeds, while Muribaculaceae and Blautia decreased in diseased individuals of two breeds. Another critical characteristic of dysbiosis in Yorkshire pigs was that diseased individuals demonstrated enrichment of Gammaproteobacteria, Bilophila, Veillonella and Prevotellaceae genera and depletion of Eubacterium, Dorea, Butyricicoccus and Lachnospiraceae. Of interest, many potentially beneficial microbes, such as Ruminococcaceae_UCG-02, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-10, Lactobacillus, Clostridia, Eubacterium and unclassified Christensenellaceae, were increased in M-DSS pigs but not Y-DSS pigs.

The data from the two breeds indicated that commensal bacteria of Min pigs might play important roles in the resistance to acute colitis. The phenotype prediction results based on the bacterial communities closely matched our experimental findings. Gram-negative bacteria were the most common co-pathogens. In M-DSS pigs, the drastic decrease in the abundance of gram-negative bacteria was accompanied by an increase in gram-positive bacteria, suggesting that potential pathogenicity decreased. In addition, the prediction results also revealed that potential pathogenicity decreased in M-DSS pigs but increased in Y-DSS pigs. The functions of the microbiome were determined by evaluating the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) profiles. In the KEGG profiles, several third-level categories were considered microbial metabolic pathways, with “lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis”, “sphingolipid metabolism”, “beta-alanine metabolism”, “taurine and hypotaurine metabolism” and “tryptophan metabolism” being the most abundant in the two breeds. Some pathways, such as “butanoate metabolism”, were enriched in Yorkshire pigs.

To gain further insight into the metabolic changes in the two breeds after DSS treatment, untargeted metabolomics analysis of colon content was performed. A total of 1578 compounds were identified in the colon metabolome. Precise results were obtained with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), which indicated a significant change in colonic metabolites after DSS treatment. The metabolites in each comparison were correlated with each other. Univariate analysis of fold change, t-test and variable importance in projection (VIP) filtering of the expressed metabolites indicated that 51 metabolites were significantly different in Min pigs, including 26 that were significantly higher and 25 that were relatively low in M-DSS pigs.
