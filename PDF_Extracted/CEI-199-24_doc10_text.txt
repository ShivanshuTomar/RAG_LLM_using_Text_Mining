# REVIEW SERIES: INTERACTIONS OF THE MICROBIOTA WITH THE MUCOSAL IMMUNE SYSTEM

# M. N. Quraishi et al.

homeostatic balance towards intestinal immunoregulatory pathways. Further careful mechanistic exploration from human FMT studies with the aim of exploring important interactions between the microbiome and the immune system will uncover potential targets for intervention and, equally importantly, the microbial triggers for IBD.

# Author contributions

M. N. Q. and W. S. performed a literature review and wrote the review. M. N. Q. prepared the figures with input from all authors. All authors read, edited, and approved the final draft.

# Disclosures

All authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.
