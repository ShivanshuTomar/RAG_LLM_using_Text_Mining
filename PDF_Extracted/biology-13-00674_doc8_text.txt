to directly mediate intestinal inflammatory responses, which has been demonstrated to stimulate the release of IL-8 from damaged intestinal epithelial cells, thereby inducing the chemotaxis of neutrophils and Th17 cells to the site of inflammation [69]. Another study revealed that mice fed with a high-salt diet had more IL-17A-producing cells within the LP than mice fed with a standard diet. Additionally, the high-salt diet triggered an intensified intestinal Th17 response while concurrently impeding the functionality of Treg cells [65]. Hernandez et al. discovered that an elevated salt intake impaired the inhibitory function of Tregs in vivo. This is achieved through the dependence on serum glucocorticoid kinase-1 (SGK1), which, in turn, impairs the inhibitory function of Tregs and promotes a Th1-type effector phenotype in Tregs with a high secretion of IFNγ. This can exacerbate autoimmune disease [70]. In conclusion, an excessive salt intake has been shown to result in alterations to the intestinal immune system, primarily through an impact on the equilibrium between Th17 cells and Treg cells. This leads to a reduction in the suppression of inflammation, while simultaneously elevating pro-inflammatory factors. This evidence suggests that a high-salt diet not only exacerbates existing intestinal inflammatory diseases such as IBD, but also increases the susceptibility of the normal gut to intestinal inflammation.

An excessive intake of salt has been demonstrated to exert an adverse effect on the immune system within the gut. Of particular note is its impact on Th17 cells and Treg cells in the LP. A diet high in salt results in an increased differentiation of primitive T-cells to Th17 cells by affecting various pathways, primarily SGK1. This leads to an elevated production of IL17 pro-inflammatory factors and an increased inflammatory response in the gut. In the case of Treg cells, an excess of salt has the effect of suppressing their immunosuppressive function, and converting them into Th1 cells. Furthermore, a diet high in salt can result in the differentiation of macrophages towards the M1 phenotype, which in turn leads to an increase in inflammatory processes. Furthermore, salt can directly induce necrotic apoptosis of epithelial cells, thereby releasing IL18 and further increasing the number of Th17 and neutrophils in the gut.

Furthermore, a growing amount of data indicate that a high salt intake also has the ability to activate various cells and pathways to induce Th17 cells, in addition to directly stimulating an increase in these cells. In mouse models, a high salt intake has been demonstrated to exacerbate autoimmune encephalomyelitis and colitis through the proliferation of pathogenic Th17 cells [66]. As a CD4 T cell subset, Th17 cells have been demonstrated to play a dual role in the etiology of IBD, primarily exerting a pro-inflammatory effect. An animal model demonstrated that an elevated intake of salt can prompt the proliferation of Th17 cells’ differentiation within the small intestine, leading to the accumulation of Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria (LP) of the distal small intestine and increased IL-17 in both the intestine and plasma IL-17 levels [67]. IL-17, as a Th17-derived cytokine, plays a significant role in the chronic inflammatory processes that can up-regulate the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, which underpin the patho-
