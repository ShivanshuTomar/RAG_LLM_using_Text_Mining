# Fecal transplantation for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (Review)

a Downgraded one level for risk of bias. One study addressed induction of clinical remission and maintenance of clinical remission (Haifer 2022). The portion of maintenance of remission was open-label and there was significant attrition for this portion of the study.

b Downgraded one level for inconsistency. The magnitude of effect differed widely between the two studies. I2 = 72%.

c Downgraded two levels for imprecision. The number of events was small and the CIs around the summary estimate were very wide.

d Downgraded one level for risk of bias. One study was open-label and had significant attrition when FMT was used for maintenance of remission, so the assessment of risk of serious adverse events could have been biased (Haifer 2022).

e Downgraded two levels for very serious imprecision. There were no events in either study.

f Downgraded one level for risk of bias. One study was open-label and had significant attrition when FMT was used for maintenance of remission, so the assessment of risk of adverse events could have been biased (Haifer 2022).

g Downgraded two levels for severe imprecision. The CIs around the summary estimate were very wide.

h Downgraded one level for risk of bias. One study was open-label and had significant attrition when FMT was used for maintenance of endoscopic remission.

i Not downgraded for inconsistency as both studies had an effect in favor of the intervention.

j Downgraded two levels for very serious imprecision. The number of events was small and CIs around the summary estimate were very wide.

k Downgraded two levels for very serious imprecision. There was a low number of participants (10) and the CIs around the summary estimate were very wide.
