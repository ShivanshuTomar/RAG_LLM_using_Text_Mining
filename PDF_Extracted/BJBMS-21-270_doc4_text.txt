# Dikhnah Alshehri, et al.: Gut microbiota in IBD therapy

identified confounding factors, assessed changes to the mucosal microbiota in 13 and 12 children with newly diagnosed CD and UC, respectively [70]. All patients were assessed at the time of the initial presentation of active colitis. During the 3 months prior to diagnosis, no antibiotics or steroids were given and no immunosuppression drugs were prescribed. The results showed a significant reduction in microbial diversity in CD patients compared to UC patients and the control population. Surprisingly, an increase in F. prausnitzii abundance was observed in CD patients, which was markedly dissimilar to the findings of several other studies [57,71-75].

Hypothetically, serial, and comparative follow-ups of such patient cohorts enable a distinct chance to examine clear and accurate profiles of IBD associations with microbiota alterations. Outcomes of the previous studies regarding alterations in the microbiota that accompany IBD (in either CD or UC) are summarized in Table 1.

# IMMUNE DYSFUNCTION IN IBD

As mentioned above, IBDs are believed to result from an abnormal immune response to GI tract microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals, although with unclear interactions between the causative factors [63]. Indirect evidence for the involvement of microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBDs includes studies that have shown evidence of mucosal T cells react against GI tract microbiota [76], and mucosal secretion of immunoglobulin G antibodies in patients with confirmed IBD [77]. UC and CD seem to be histologically distinct, since inflammation in UC is superficial and limited to the colon, while in CD the inflammation is generally transmural, multi-focal and can contain granulomas. Immunologically, UC and CD are also separate. In general, “helper” T cells are divided into Th1 and Th2 subsets, depending on the cytokines types that they produce. This observation was reported in the 1980s in mice, so may not be equitable with human T cells. However, in general, CD can be regarded as a Th1-type inflammatory process, with increased expression of IFN-γ and IL-2, in addition to the Th1-inducing cytokine, IL-12. The UC cytokine profile is different. There is increased expression of IL-5 and IL-13, and cytokines are more commonly associated with a Th2 response; however, the archetypal Th2 cytokine IL-4 is not upregulated, and increased levels of IFN-γ are seen [78]. Latterly, non-Th1/Th2 pathways have been characterized to be involved in IBD pathogenesis. Another interleukin, IL-23, is an inducer of a different subset of pro-inflammatory T cells, known as Th17 cells, owing to their high level of IL-17 production [79]. High expression of IL-17 has been reported in active CD and UC and may be of potential as a future therapeutic target [79].

Of particular note, it has also been found that overproduction of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by CD14+ macrophages, fibroblasts, and T cells is associated with IBD pathogenesis. TNF enhances several pro-inflammatory properties in chronic intestinal inflammation, including epithelial cell damage [80]. Importantly, a number of pro-inflammatory effects are mediated by membrane-bound TNF, instead of soluble TNF, which indicates the therapeutic potential of targeting the pathway of the membrane-bound TNF and its receptor, TNF-R2 [81]. Accordingly, an improvement of the gut inflammation in mice with IBD was observed after treatment with anti-TNF. Clinically, studies have revealed the effectiveness of suppressing the TNF effect by neutralizing its antibodies in CD and UC [82]. Hence, a number of antibodies to TNF that target soluble TNF plus membrane-bound TNF, such as infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) are at present in routine clinical use for IBD treatment [83]. IFX is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody against TNF-α used for patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease. However, many IBD patients show no response to anti-TNF treatment or it may lose clinical response effectiveness over time, which prompts the development of novel therapeutic approaches [84].

# IS THE GUT MICROBIAL DYSBIOSIS THAT ACCOMPANIES IBD A CAUSE OR A CONSEQUENCE?

It has been difficult to find clear evidence whether dysbiosis observed with IBD is a cause or an outcome of the disease. This point must be addressed since it has direct implications on therapeutic drug development and diagnostic and prognostic investigations, as well as on strategies used to predict individuals’ response to therapies [85].

On the one hand, based on observation, dysbiosis is considered a cause of IBD, with T-cells as mediators of chronic experimental inflammation [86,87]. For instance, mice were observed to develop inflammation after being given transferred stools of mice with colitis [88]. Additionally, CD patients that underwent a fecal transplantation procedure showed a reduction in inflammation and an enhancement of the role of certain probiotic combinations [89]. Although dysbiosis may be present at initial stages before disease progression and treatment administration, it is thought that it may be caused by earlier usage of antibiotics [73,90].

On the other hand, some studies have suggested that dysbiosis is a consequence of combined factors, including inflammation, antibiotics usage, and dietary intake, which affect the homeostasis of microbial communities [91]. A number of studies have revealed that ileal inflammation has a direct impact on bacterial composition and also alters gene expression [92-95]. A study conducted on mice demonstrated that alterations in gene expression of enteric species were delivered by inflammation, while disruptions targeting E. coli.
