# Funding

This study was funded by Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) through the ATTRACT program grant (FNR/A12/01 to I.T.), the National Centre of Excellence in Research (NCER) on Parkinson’s disease, and the OPEN (FNR/O16/11402054) grant and by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 757922).

# Availability of data and materials

The annotated bile acid pathway genes are represented as a subsystem at the PubSEED website [69]. The expanded AGORA reconstructions generated in this study are available at the VMH database (https://vmh.life) [16]. The simulation results are shown in this article and its Supplementary files. Scripts used to analyze simulation results are available as a tutorial in the COBRA Toolbox [34] GitHub (https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox) and rely on the COBRA Toolbox [34], COBRA.jl [76], and the Microbiome Modeling Toolbox [33].

# Authors’ contributions

AH and IT conceived the study. DAR performed the comparative genomic analysis and formulation of bile acid reactions. AH performed the expansion of AGORA reconstructions, microbiome modeling simulations, and analysis of simulation results. FB constructed the microbiome models. LH and RMTF provided tools and computational infrastructure for large-scale simulations. IT supervised the study. AH, DAR, and IT wrote the manuscript. All authors read, edited, and approved the final manuscript.
