Significant among these biomarkers are anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactoferrin, and calprotectin (Bennike, 2014). According to Zheng et al. (2017), salivary exosomal proteasome subunit alpha type 7 (PSMA7) shows promise as a biomarker for IBD when exosomes from both IBD patients and healthy individuals are compared, and expression levels of this exosomal protein are higher in CD patients than UC patients. Leoni et al. (2015) report that in comparison with healthy controls, IBD patients express high levels of endogenous ANXA1-containing EVs. Given that ANXA1-containing EVs increase in circulation in response to the inflammatory process, Leoni et al. (2015) noted that it could potentially serve as a biomarker of intestinal mucosal inflammation. In another study, EVs obtained from intestinal luminal aspirates of an IBD patient were estimated to have a mean concentration of 4.3 × 1010 particles/ml and a mean diameter of 146 nm. Their stability in luminal samples as well as their protein and mRNA content identify them as a potential faecal biomarker that reflects mucosal inflammation (Mitsuhashi et al., 2016). Liu et al. (2018a) suggest a potential application of the exosomal RNA NEAT1 as a biomarker for the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of IBD, however detailed examination of the mechanisms underlying the participation of NEAT1 in the pathogenesis of IBD are still needed. The ability to identify a highly specific and sensitive biomarker for IBD would not only promote early-stage and accurate diagnosis, but could also improve treatment, prognosis and potentially lead to the discovery of biological pathways upon which novel therapies could be developed. There is much to be gained from further investigations of these markers and their associated molecules and pathways.

# XII. DISCUSSION

While stem cell-based therapy has achieved significant success in its applications in regenerative medicine, challenges remain and only a few cellular therapies have obtained approval for sale worldwide despite huge investment (Cuende et al., 2018). Adverse outcomes have been documented in the use of stem cells in clinical trials, including the development of tumours in a kidney failure patient, and blindness in a macular degeneration patient (Kuriyan et al., 2017). These, among other factors elaborated in a recent review (Ocansey et al., 2020), have led to a new focus on exosomes as packages of beneficial biomolecules released by stem cells and other cells. Exosomes act naturally as intercellular messengers that promote communication between cells. Their release by healthy cells following activation, or constitutively, results in important immunomodulatory functions. These vesicles are essential for healthy physiology, however under certain pathological conditions, they can potentiate cellular stress and damage (Isola & Chen, 2016).

The use of exosomes as an alternative to stem cell therapies is likely to be simpler, safer and lower cost; they are more easily stored and transported and their therapeutic application avoids many of the problems associated with the administration of parental stem cells. Additional benefits include the fact that they pose less risk of triggering adverse immune responses, they are non-oncogenic, have high stability, cannot replicate (hence are incapable of transforming into malignant cells or other harmful cell types), and cannot be infected with viruses. They also possess high tissue-specific homing capacity and a low vascular-obstructive propensity. In relation to IBD, exosomes are known to regulate immune cells and cytokines within the inflammatory microenvironment. This modulation results in dampened inflammation, restored intestinal barrier integrity and restored gut microbiome composition and diversity. Systemic injection of exosomes at the onset of colitis and during chronic colitis decreases disease severity. Exosome infusion also inhibits the recurrence of DSS-induced IBD following subsequent DSS administration (Liu et al., 2019). The anti-inflammatory activities of exosomes include the polarization of macrophages into the M2 phenotype, which can result in a severe and distressing complication of IBD called intestinal fibrosis (Lawrance et al., 2015). The existing data do not implicate the therapeutic application of exosomes in the formation of intestinal fibrosis (Liu et al., 2019), although this requires further investigation.

The human intestinal mucosal surface represents the primary defence against pathogens, and modulates the immune response via resident immunological factors as well as IEC functions. IECs act as sensors of luminal stimuli, interacting with the gut microbiome and immune cells through signalling transduction pathways, thus representing the first barrier that food, pathogens and chemicals that trigger IBD encounter. Exosomes crucially participate in this IEC–microbiome–immune system interaction to maintain mucosal homeostasis. Alterations to intestinal exosome proteomics alone can lead to abnormal host–gut microbiota interactions causing dysbiosis (Zhang et al., 2018b). Several studies have demonstrated the regulatory effects of exosomes on restoring gut microbiota composition and diversity, as well as modulating gene transcription and growth of gut bacteria. In the host immune system, exosomes generally induce Treg, regulatory DCs and M2 phenotype macrophages, resulting in immunosuppressive effects within the IBD microenvironment. These vesicles directly modulate IEC development, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as tight junction molecules. These powerful modulatory effects of exosomes within the IBD microenvironment make them ideal candidates for treating and preventing the recurrence of IBD.

Notwithstanding, some studies have demonstrated pro-inflammatory effects of exosomes (mainly from infected cells or IBD patients) on intestinal tissues and immune cells like macrophages. This shows that both anti-inflammatory-mediating exosomes and pro-inflammatory-mediating exosomes are found within the IBD microenvironment. Pro-inflammatory-mediating exosomes and their cargos seem to be enriched during active IBD, hence the continued inflammation. The balance between these vesicles in the mucosal microenvironment likely.
