# Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic remitting and relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Persistent inflammation and continuing insult lead to fibrosis, scarring, and the need for multiple surgeries. The pathogenesis of IBD is complex and poorly understood. A disturbance of intestinal mucosal homeostasis, influenced by genetic factors, the intestinal microbiome, the immune system, and environmental exposures, is believed to underlie IBD [1, 2]. While 200 distinct genetic loci have been associated with IBD in a recent report [3], many of these genes point to pathways involving bacterial recognition or host response to microbial infections, both clearly influenced by the environment.

Although the prevalence of adult-onset IBD has plateaued in the Westernized world, recent population-based studies on IBD from Canada [4], the USA [5], and Europe [6] suggest a rapid increase in pediatric-onset IBD, particularly in children younger than 10 years. Genetic causes are unlikely to account for these epidemiological findings. The risk of IBD among first-generation immigrants to the Western world from south Asia and Africa as well as the prevalence of IBD in native Asia or Africa are exceedingly low, yet second-generation immigrants have a greatly increased risk similar to that in the location to which they immigrated [7]. This emerging global rise of pediatric IBD incidence has fueled a quest to identify early life exposures including potential microbiome alterations due to lifestyle and diet that could explain the increasing risk for IBD among children [8, 9].

Several studies have described characteristic patterns within the gut microbiome of patients with IBD [10–13]. In general, shifts in bacterial taxa and decreased community diversity have been found in treatment-naïve CD [14] and in IBD in general [15–17], with the extent of dysbiosis associated with severity of inflammation [18]; however, it is not clear whether these changes are a cause or consequence of IBD [2]. In one recent study involving a large number of subjects, the microbiome of treatment-naïve pediatric CD patients had a distinct signature compared to non-IBD subjects, as measured by both fecal and intestinal mucosa bacterial ecosystems [19]. However, this study used primarily mucosal biopsies and was limited to a single time point—it did not capture the dynamics of the gut microbiome over time. One recent study showed that dysbiosis results from independent effects of inflammation, diet, and antibiotics after selected subjects with pediatric Crohn’s disease were treated with enteral nutrition and some conventional medications [18]. Although this study measured the bacterial community before and after intervention, the study only provided data for an 8-week study period and only 4 samples per patient. Long-term data are still lacking regarding dysbiosis subjects who undergo standard-of-care treatment in clinical practice.

Once IBD is diagnosed, patients undergo a series of treatments to induce clinical remission, in which mucosal healing is promoted by controlling mucosal inflammation. Some patients respond clinically to treatment with normalization of symptoms and evidence of mucosal healing seen in repeat colonoscopies (“responders” or “remitters”); other patients continue to have persistent inflammation or a remitting-relapsing disease course with a variable degree of mucosal inflammation (“non-responders” or “non-remitters”). It is critically important to study the intestinal microbiome over the course of treatment to identify whether there are microbial signatures that distinguish these different outcomes. This can be achieved with longitudinal microbiome analysis, starting at diagnosis and following up throughout treatment in parallel with clinical characterization. We hypothesize that distinct signatures of microbiota can be found and applied in clinical practice to assess ongoing inflammation and predict response to treatment. An important study by Kolho et al. examined the treatment responses using fecal calprotectin in patients with median disease duration of 3.5 years after diagnosis [20]. Although our study was similar, our study design differed from that of Kolho et al. in that we used mucosal healing in addition to fecal calprotectin as a measure of mucosal inflammation and used sequencing rather than phylogenetic microarrays to classify species levels.

Here we report the results of a longitudinal investigation of 19 children diagnosed with IBD, of whom 15 had a final diagnosis of CD and 4 had a final diagnosis of UC. All 19 subjects were recruited from a single center, were treatment-naïve at the time of enrollment, were treated with current standards of practice guidelines, and were followed clinically for a median of 8 months. Treatment regimens were not protocolized, but treatment was escalated to maximal medical therapy or surgical resection was recommended if, upon clinical evaluation, the subject was categorized as a non-responder to previous treatment. We also recruited and followed 10 unaffected controls for comparison: 6 family members and 4 unrelated controls. We measured fecal calprotectin in all samples as an objective measure of inflammation as well as the subjective clinical disease activity indices (Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] or Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI]). The strength of our study lies in the dense longitudinal data collection (217 total visits—a median of 8 time points for both cases and controls), thorough clinical characterization of our patients at each visit, measurement of clinical disease activity indices, and simultaneous use of fecal calprotectin as an objective measure of mucosal inflammation. We comprehensively analyzed inflammation, diversity, and dysbiosis by standard methods including the previously.
