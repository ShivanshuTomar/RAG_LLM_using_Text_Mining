# NEURO-IMMUNE INTERACTIONS: HOW THE NERVOUS AND IMMUNE SYSTEMS INFLUENCE EACH OTHER

# Depressive symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease

As well as in IBD, the gut–brain axis is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms in general. In people with depressive symptoms, the wide range of anti-inflammatory treatments in IBD – including immunomodulators, systemic biologicals and gut-specific biologicals – provide unique opportunities to alter the gut–brain axis at different points. Studies testing systemic- and gut-specific agents in depression would help to define the most effective points at which inflammation can be modified to break the cycle of worsening depressive symptoms and IBD outcomes. Changes in depressive symptoms could be tracked over multiple time-points against changes in peripheral inflammation, gut inflammation and even central inflammation. Finally, comparison with other chronic inflammatory conditions would help to define whether there is a somatic subtype of depression that is driven by inflammation and seen across inflammatory conditions.

# Summary

Depressive symptoms are a common co-morbidity in people with IBD and are associated with a worse course of IBD, which is incompletely explained by psychological factors alone. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are particularly common, whether as part of a broader depressive illness or not. Inflammation provides a promising shared origin for both depressive symptoms and poor IBD outcomes. Specifically, changes to the gut microbiome occur in high-risk groups, which leads to exaggerated immune responses. Excess inflammation is then associated with both worsening depressive symptoms and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Established treatments for both depressive symptoms and for IBD provide opportunities to break this cycle by reducing both the causes and effects of inflammation. With a range of treatments targeting inflammation centrally, peripherally and in the gut specifically, IBD provides a unique disease model for understanding the interplay between brain and gut in the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms, both in IBD and in the whole population.
