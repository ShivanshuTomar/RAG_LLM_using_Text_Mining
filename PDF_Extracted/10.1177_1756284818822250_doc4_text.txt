# Metatranscriptomics

The filtered sequences are then aligned to a microbial translated protein sequence such as the UniProt database and functional databases such as KEGG or SEED.

There are several major limitations of metatranscriptomics. Tissues such as colonic biopsies consist of a significant amount of host contamination where host cells make up nearly 95% of the biomass. Such cases require deep sequencing of the total mRNA in order to obtain a representative window into the mucosally-adherent microbial gene expression profile. The microbial transcriptome or translated protein databases are not comprehensive and consist of a large number of genes that are currently not yet annotated to a known function. This knowledge gap often leads to an incomplete, and to a certain extent, biased interpretation of the microbial functional profile, but is likely to change as this field evolves over time.

# Metatranscriptomics in IBD

As metatranscriptomics is a relatively new technology, there is a paucity of data for gut microbial transcriptomic profiling in health or any given disease. The largest faecal metatranscriptome study in IBD was conducted as part of the Integrative Human Microbiome project (IBD multi’omics database). In this study, metagenomic analysis was paired with metatranscriptomic analysis from 117 individuals (24 non-IBD healthy controls, 59 patients with CD, 34 with UC). They found that the gut microbial functional potential (based on metagenomics) is often but not always proportional to metatranscriptomic profiles. Multiple metabolic pathways were found to be differentially expressed, such as the methylerythritol phosphate pathway predominantly by Alistipes putredinis and dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis by F. prausnitzii. These pathways are associated with inducing or regulating inflammation, immune response and altering interspecies interactions in the gut. This study represented the first step towards a new way of interpreting ‘dysbiosis’ in IBD by going beyond microbial compositional profiling and contextualizing altered microbial gene expression in relation to disease. The field of metatranscriptomics will continue to evolve our understanding of host–microbiome relationship in IBD in the coming years.

# Metaproteomics

Metaproteomics involves the high-throughput characterization of the entire constituent profile of microbial proteins within a biofluid or tissue sample. A key utility of metaproteomic studies is that the identification of the protein content of a sample, coupled with insight to their interactions, abundances, and modifications, gives direct information about the true functional activity of the gut microbiota. As already discussed, this level of functional insight is not typically captured by studies focused on microbial sequencing alone. A range of different methodologies may be used for proteomic studies, including both gel-based and gel-free techniques, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and microarray-based technologies.

However, as for other omics technologies, there are potential limitations that must be considered when performing and interpreting proteomic studies. The proteome is vast in its scale and complexity (with proteins often interacting in networks rather than functioning singularly), which translates to high complexity in the processing and analysis of proteomic data. While the Human Proteome Project database (https://hupo.org/human-proteome-project) is available to researchers, there are no definitive reference metaproteomic databases available at present. Differences exist between proteome profiles established using alternate methodologies or after analysis in different laboratories. There are disparities between the metaproteome of gut mucus, luminal content and faecal material.

# Metaproteomics in IBD

While metaproteomics as applied to IBD is a relatively novel field, there are a growing number of studies in which it has been applied. In one of the first such investigations, different stool metaproteome profiles were observed between human patients with CD in comparison with healthy individuals, with patients with CD (and particularly with those with the disease in an ileal distribution) having a particular depletion of a large range of microbial proteins. A further area in which metaproteomics has been applied has been in the analysis of the mucosal-luminal interface, with the aim of better elucidating any aberrations in gut microbiota–host interactions that may contribute to the onset or activity level of IBD. A study from Li and colleagues identified distinct protein modules at the mucosal-luminal interface; these differed between healthy controls and patients with IBD, and, in the case of certain modules, differentiated UC from CD.
