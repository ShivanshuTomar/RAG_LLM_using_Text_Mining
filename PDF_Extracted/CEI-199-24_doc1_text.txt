# REVIEW SERIES: INTERACTIONS OF THE MICROBIOTA WITH THE MUCOSAL IMMUNE SYSTEM

# Immune mechanisms of FMT in UC

In studies exploring multiple aspects of host immune interactions with gut microbiota and their manipulation, we are progressively uncovering key mechanisms of causality and discovering novel treatment targets for IBD [7]. In this review, we discuss evidence for the causal role of gut microbiota in driving proinflammatory pathways in IBD and the immunological mechanisms that restore homeostatic balance as a consequence of its manipulation by faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).

# Host immune microbiota relationships govern IBD

The gut faces the exceptional challenge of maintaining intestinal immune tolerance and host mutualism to the vast and diverse commensal microbiota while mounting an appropriate defence to pathogens. Host immune cells, in conjunction with the intestinal barrier, manage this through a variety of immunological mechanisms that, in addition to the cellular and humoral immune responses, include mucus secretion, immunoglobulin (Ig)A) and antimicrobial peptides. This immune homeostasis, in turn, facilitates the maintenance of a relatively stable gut microbial community while limiting the colonization of pathogenic organisms. Dysregulation of many facets of the mucosal immune homeostasis is the cardinal feature that drives disease in IBD. Genomewide association studies in IBD demonstrate variants among candidate genes involved in multiple immune pathways, including antigen-sensing, immune cell trafficking and pathogen handling [8,9]. With the alarming rate of increase in the global incidence and prevalence of IBD, it appears more likely that environmentally derived immune triggers are driving the development of IBD, rather than a seeming unlikely rapid increase in the pool of these gene variants. Regions in Asia, which are currently viewing the highest incidence of IBD, are genetically distinct from western countries, which were deemed traditionally to be high-risk areas [10].

Epidemiological studies have identified a number of environmental influences associated with the development of IBD, ranging from events at birth and exposure to antibiotics in early life to a western diet [11–13]. Although no direct causality can be associated with these factors in the disruption of mucosal immune homeostasis it is clear that, individually, these have a major effect on the development and maintenance of gut microbiota. Studies have consistently shown that patients with IBD have significant dysbiosis compared to those without disease. Expansion of potential pathogens as well as global reduction in the symbiotic species and compositional diversity have been consistently described. Members of the phylum Firmicutes, specifically Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, have been shown to be reduced in both stool and mucosal biopsies, while the phylum Proteobacteria comprising species such as Escherichia coli and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family are found to be increased in patients with IBD when compared to healthy individuals [4,14–17]. These alterations appear to be represented by a reduced abundance of butyrate-producing species that include Blautia faecis, Roseburia inulinivorans, Ruminococcus torques and F. prausnitzii, and an increase in sulphate-reducing bacteria such as Desulfovibrio and other species with proinflammatory properties, such as adhesion-invasive E. coli (AIEC) in IBD [18–20]. Collectively and consistently these findings strongly indicate that the alteration of gut microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. Whether this is a primary or secondary event and if the mucosal immune response is appropriate or exaggerated are two of the fundamental questions that remain to be answered [21]. While a single causative agent has remained elusive, the origin of IBD is likely to be a consequence of an aberrant host immunological response (influenced partly by genetic predisposition) of an environmentally dictated shift in the gut microbiota.

# Evidence of the causal role of dysbiosis for proinflammatory innate and adaptive immune responses in IBD

There is considerable evidence demonstrating complex dynamic and bi-directional mechanistic relationships between gut microbiota and immune-mediated inflammatory responses which contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD.

# Innate immunity

The gut mucosal innate immune response is ostensibly directed towards one or many foreign antigens and pathogens [22,23]. Microbial sensing occurs through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as flagellin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP). Gene polymorphisms of these receptors, together with increased expression in innate immune cells, have been described in patients with IBD [24–26]. Specific TLRs are associated with induction of either inflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses. Mucosal macrophages and dendritic cells demonstrate up-regulation of TLR-2 and TLR-4 as well as CD40 and chemokine receptor C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) in patients with UC and CD compared to healthy controls [27]. This consequently promotes inflammation through increased production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-18 and members of the IL-12 family. Colonization of germ-free (GF) mice with a complex gut microbiota augments the expression of TLR-2 and is partly reversed by broad-spectrum antibiotics [28]. This effect appears to be bi-directional, as
