Previous research has reported some signatures in gut microbiota and metabolites10–12, but the differences among various studies have made it challenging to validate these signatures across diverse groups, reducing the diagnostic value of the microbiome and metabolome in IBD. Therefore, there is an urgent need for multi-national, large-scale cohorts, multiomics characterization, standardized sampling analysis, as well as model systems to uncover the relationship between gut microbiota and their functions with gut metabolites13. Cross-cohort integrative analysis (CCIA) is expected to address these challenges by assessing the robustness of disease-microbiome associations through the comparison of several case-control studies. The goal of CCIA is to identify consistent associations across various cohorts, thus minimizing the impact of biological or technical confounders. The remarkable performance of CCIA in some prior studies highlights its potential as a valuable tool in various research fields14–16.

In this work, we comprehensively analyzed nine metagenomic cohorts (N = 1363 cases) and four metabolomics cohorts (N = 398 cases) of IBD patients from different countries or regions through CCIA. Our objective was to identify specific gut bacteria, metabolites, and their associated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology (KO) genes that contribute to the development of IBD across diverse cohorts. We also aimed to create diagnostic models using disease-specific biomarkers from diverse cohorts to enhance IBD diagnosis. Furthermore, we sought to clarify the intricate relationships among these bacteria, metabolites, and KO genes within the context of IBD. Ultimately, our research holds the potential to provide fresh insights for the diagnosis and treatment of IBD.

# Workflow for cross-cohort integration analysis of fecal metagenomics and metabolomics in IBD

In this study, we employed a multi-omics approach that integrates fecal metagenomics and metabolomics to investigate alterations in the gut microbiota of IBD. A total of 9 metagenomic cohorts from four different regions or countries (n = 1363 cases) were included in this study. These cohorts were divided into six discovery cohorts and three validation cohorts (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). Additionally, we included four metabolomic cohorts (n = 398 cases), of which two external cohorts were examined using non-targeted metabolomics, and two in-house cohorts were examined using targeted metabolomics (Fig. 1a).

To ensure consistency in the bioinformatic analyses, we applied the MetaPhlan3 tool for taxonomic profiling and HUMAnN3 for functional profiling to reprocess all raw sequencing data. Furthermore, by annotating metabolite names with a unified ID using the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), we identified 79 metabolites that were shared among the four cohorts. These metabolites will be utilized in a cross-cohort analysis of metabolomics data (Fig. 1b).

Furthermore, our aim is to reveal the patterns of variation in gut microbiota and fecal metabolites through a comprehensive statistical analysis, and then utilize machine learning techniques for diagnosing IBD. Initially, we excluded samples that were repeatedly collected from external cohorts. Then, we utilized a sequence of differential analyses and feature selection to identify 31 species, 25 functional genes, and 13 metabolites that were effective in diagnosing IBD patients. Subsequently, we selected four cohorts containing both metagenomic and metabolomic data (n = 391 cases) for integrated analysis, enabling us to establish the most precise diagnostic model. Finally, to explore gut microbiota-related metabolic processes, we introduced the multi-omics biological correlation (MOBC) maps framework (Fig. 1c).

# Identification of bacterial biomarkers at the species level for diagnosing IBD through cross-cohorts

The main goal of the CCIA was to discover particular gut microbial species that exhibited consistent alterations in abundance metagenomes of individuals with IBD. Prior to the analysis, it was imperative to evaluate the impact of cohort-related variations (CRV) on the microbiome composition since there were differences among the cohorts in terms of biological and technical factors. To mitigate the impact of confounding variables, we compared the identified gut microbial species with other factors such as patient age, gender, cohort, country, body mass index (BMI), and antibiotic use. Our analysis revealed that the factor of “cohort” or “country” had a significant impact on the species composition (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Therefore, to minimize potential biases, we restricted subsequent analysis to patients within the same country in a single cohort and processed the metagenomic data using the same analysis method.

We next evaluated the alpha diversity by measuring the Shannon and Simpson index, and found that IBD patients exhibited lower microbial alpha diversity compared to healthy controls (FDR < 0.0001) (Fig. 2b, c). In addition, it’s important to note that the dissimilarities in beta diversity, which were calculated using the Bray-Curtis distance metric, were found to vary not only based on the disease status (as indicated by a PERMANOVA analysis with P = 0.001) but also across different cohorts (as indicated by a PERMANOVA analysis with P = 0.001) (Fig. 2d). Thus, reduced microbial diversity observed in IBD patients may play a significant role in disrupting the delicate balance of the gut ecosystem and could be a contributing factor to the development of IBD.

To identify potential microbial biomarkers for the diagnosis of IBD, we employed a method provided by a previous study to analyze the composition of microbial species15. Through CCIA with an FDR less than 0.0001, 74 microbial species were identified to have significantly different abundances in the gut microbiomes (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 2). Despite significant differences in diet and genetics among IBD patients from various regions or countries, a consistent pattern of alteration in their gut microbiota was observed. Our results suggest that IBD patients exhibit a significant reduction in commensal gut microbiota, which are crucial for various activities of their hosts. Several species, known to produce butyric acid17,18, were found to be depleted in the gut microbiota of IBD, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis, Eubacterium hallii, Gemmiger formicilis, Eubacterium rectale, and Ruminococcus bromii (Fig. 2e). In addition, our study suggests that certain bacteria involved in other intestinal metabolism, including those associated with mineral metabolism (such as Collinsella aerofaciens involved in iron metabolism19), bile acid metabolism20 (such as Ruminococcus torques), and urea cycle metabolism21 (such as Bifidobacterium longum), all of which demonstrate a significant decrease (Fig. 2e). Some bacteria that antagonize pro-inflammatory microorganisms are also significantly reduced. Alistipes putredinis showed a negative correlation with the colonization of Candida albicans, which is enriched in the gut of IBD patients and exacerbates intestinal inflammation by inducing Th17 cell differentiation22,23. Notably, through a comprehensive analysis, we have successfully identified two specific microbial species, Asaccharobacter celatus and Gemmiger formicilis, which are depleted across six distinct IBD cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 2c). However, previous studies have not extensively investigated or emphasized the relationship between these bacteria and IBD. Asaccharobacter celatus possesses the ability to produce Equol24, which has the potential to alleviate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice25. This implies a potential role for Asaccharobacter celatus in the regulation of autoimmune diseases.

Furthermore, our study also revealed that certain bacteria, including Ruminococcus gnavus, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium innocuum were consistently enriched in IBD (Fig. 2e). Ruminococcus gnavus can produce pro-inflammatory polysaccharides and mucin-degrading trans-sialidase, which disrupts the intestinal mucosal barrier and promotes inflammation26–28. In clinical practice, special attention should be paid to Clostridium innocuum infection in IBD patients.
