# Identification of bacterial biomarkers at the species level for diagnosing IBD through cross-cohorts

a Overall composition of the population across 9 metagenomic datasets (n = 1363).
b, c The alpha diversity of IBD (red, n = 795) and control (blue, n = 395) was measured using the Shannon index and Simpson index.
The adjusted p value (two-sided test) was calculated using MMUPHin tools.
The data in boxplots is represented using interquartile ranges (IQRs), with the median shown as a horizontal line,
and the whiskers extending to the most extreme points within 1.5 times the IQR.
Exact p values are provided in the Source data file.

d Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) shows significant differences in microbial composition between both groups (P = 0.001)
and cohorts (P = 0.001). The significance of beta diversity based on Bray-Curtis distance was calculated using PERMANOVA
with 999 permutations (two-sided test, n = 1190). The data in boxplots is represented using interquartile ranges (IQRs),
with the median shown as a black horizontal line, and the whiskers extending to the most extreme points within 1.5 times the IQR.
e The top bar graph displays the 74 gut bacterial species with the most significant differences (P < 0.0001),
as calculated using a two-sided Wilcoxon test with FDR-corrected P values.
Among these species, 31 are highlighted in dark gray as feature species for subsequent random forest modeling (Confirmed).
The middle bar graph shows the generalized fold change (gFC) of these 74 significant species,
with red indicating 11 species that are enriched in IBD and blue indicating 63 species that are depleted in IBD.
At the bottom, heatmaps are shown in gray and in color, respectively, displaying the species-level significance and the gFC within individual cohorts.

(f) The classification models accuracy of IBD resulting from 10-fold cross-validation was assessed within each cohort
(gray boxes along the diagonal), as well as cohort-to-cohort model transfer (external validations off-diagonal),
using the AUROC for classifiers trained on species abundance profiles.
g The classification models accuracy, as evaluated by AUROC on a hold-out cohort, improves when taxonomic data from all other cohorts
are combined for training using leave-one-cohort-out (LOCO) validation, compared to models trained on data from a single cohort
(cohort-to-cohort transfer). The error bars indicate the mean ± sd, n = 5. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

# Identification of IBD diagnostic markers by demonstrating variations of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology (KO) across different IBD cohorts

Metagenomic functional analysis plays a critical role in understanding the complex interactions between the gut microbiome and human health.
In our study, we first annotated gene families obtained from metagenomic analysis as KO genes using the KEGG orthology database,
resulting in 9,270 KO genes. We applied a low-abundance filtering step to obtain a final set of 3,732 KO genes,
followed by differential abundance analysis using the same method as earlier.
To avoid overfitting of the model, we used a strict FDR approach (CCIA analysis FDR < 1×10−12),
which led to the identification of 162 differentially expressed KO genes between normal and IBD patients (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Tables 3).
Most of these KO genes are classified as potentially coding for metabolic enzymes, particularly those involved in amino acid and other metabolism.
This indicates a strong association between gut microbiota and their metabolic activities.

Subsequently, an enrichment analysis was conducted on these genes, uncovering 12 pathways with potential implications for both gut microbiota and disease (FDR < 0.05).
Among these pathways, four of them displayed an upregulated pattern, including “Cell cycle – Caulobacter,”
“Two-component system,” “Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis,” and “Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis” (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
Specifically, Two-component systems play a critical role in regulating virulence factors in certain bacteria.
Among the 8 KO genes enriched in the Two-component system pathway, crp (K10914, CRP/FNR family transcriptional regulator)
stands out as the gene with the highest generalized fold change (Supplementary Fig. 3b).
Previous studies have indicated its potential involvement in various biological processes, such as osmoregulation, stringent response, and biofilm formation.
Furthermore, the relative abundance of crp is positively correlated with fecal calprotectin (Supplementary Fig. 3c).
These findings suggest that crp could potentially act as a critical transcriptional regulatory factor contributing to the occurrence of gut inflammation.

Additionally, we have also observed the downregulation of several pathways in IBD, such as Propanoate metabolism,
Phosphotransferase system (PTS), Styrene degradation, Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis, and Biosynthesis of amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
It has been reported that Akkermansia-related propanoate metabolism enhanced the development of the intestinal epithelium
through intestinal stem cell-mediated mechanisms, where intestinal stem cells (ISCs) play a vital role in the developmental processes
and swift regeneration of the intestinal lining.

Additionally, we sought to assess the potential diagnostic usefulness of the KO genes in IBD.
We utilized the IFE method for feature selection and identified 25 KO genes as features for random forest modeling out of the 162 KO genes.
After conducting a 10-fold cross-validation analysis, we observed that all cohorts, except for the HeQ.
