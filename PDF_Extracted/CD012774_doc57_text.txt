|Bias Type|Risk|Quote|Comment|
|---|---|---|---|
|Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)|Low risk|Patients and investigators were unaware of treatment allocation. (page 1220)|most likely done.|
|Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)|Low risk|Study investigators who played a part in patients' assessment did not see the investigational product at any time. (page 1220)|most likely done.|
|Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)|Low risk| |the overall attrition rate was > 20%; however, the dropout rates and reasons were similar between both groups.|
|Selective reporting (reporting bias)|Low risk| |all intended outcomes were reported in the paper. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01896635).|
|Other bias|Low risk| |no other risk of bias noted.|
