Clusters and modules (P value &lt; 0.01; one-sample t test; mean ARI with random GNPS clusters: −2.9 × 10−5; mean ARI with random MACARRoN modules: 2.7 × 10−5) (Fig. EV1). We expected this to be the case since MACARRoN associates metabolic features based on covariance, which can arise from several underlying processes, while GNPS relies solely on chemical similarity which is inferred from MS2 fragmentation similarity. MACARRoN modules thus tend to be complementary to GNPS clusters: functionally unrelated compounds rarely co-cluster in either method, but compounds related for different reasons are captured by one versus the other.

Finally, we evaluated mass-differences (Δm/zs) between unannotated features and co-clustered standards from the HMP2 metabolomes. We hypothesized that if the modules are indeed functionally or biochemically consistent, the distribution of Δm/z values should be significantly non-random. We tested this using the set of annotated-modules by shuffling module labels and comparing the resulting distributions of Δm/zs to the real distribution. These were significantly different (mean Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic over 1000 iterations: 0.23 ± 0.02; P value &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the higher number of smaller mass-differences in the actual distribution was noteworthy, indicating that MACARRoN often associates compounds by covariation that also likely differ in only a few small functional groups.

To quantify this, we performed a permutation test to identify Δm/zs that were significantly enriched in the annotated-modules. For this, we considered the 601 positive (unannotated m/z &gt; co-clustered standard m/z) and 682 negative (unannotated m/z &lt; co-clustered standard m/z) Δm/zs that were observed at least twice. Briefly, we estimated the frequency of the 1283 Δm/zs in random modules generated by shuffling module labels (10,000 iterations) and then calculated the respective empirical P values (see “Methods”). After FDR correction, 24 positive and 7 negative Δm/zs were found to be significantly enriched (Fig. 2E). Mass-differences associated with commonly observed molecular groups such as amino, acetyl, carbonyl, methyl, and nitro moieties were among the most enriched (adjusted P value &lt; 0.01), highlighting potential intra-module biochemical relationships. In agreement with the hypothesis that some chemical classes are more likely to attract certain functional groups than others, the enriched Δm/zs were found to be non-uniformly distributed across annotated-modules, with module coverage ranging from 35.5 to 63.7% (Fig. 2E,F). Notably, the most common molecular groups were also the most evenly covered, again in agreement with their ubiquity in biochemical pathways. Similarly, we observed that the coverage of Δm/zs, i.e., percentage of total Δm/zs observed in each module, varied considerably, from 3.2 to 100% (Fig. 2F). Expectedly, Δm/z coverage was observed to be size-dependent, with larger modules having a higher Δm/z coverage (Fig. 2G). It was also interesting to note that the instances where smaller (size &lt;100) modules had higher Δm/z coverage (e.g., modules 128, 209, 189) were associated with higher numbers of standards. Taken together, our analyses based on chemical homogeneity and mass-differences showed that covarying abundance modules contain metabolites that are functionally related.

# Potential bioactives covary with IBD- (or gut-) relevant standard compounds

Approximately 33% of prevalent features were significantly perturbed during IBD, including well-studied metabolite families such as bile acids and SCFAs in addition to many unidentified features (Fig. 1C). To assess the diversity and importance of these unidentified IBD-linked features, we studied the chemical diversity of standards with which they covaried, as well as their abundances relative to the same standards. In our first step to characterize the unidentified potential bioactives, we labeled annotated-modules as “IBD-relevant” if ≥25% metabolic features in them were significantly (q value &lt; 0.05) perturbed with respect to at least one of the four categories i.e., (1) CD-dysbiosis enriched, (2) UC enriched, (3) CD-dysbiosis depleted, or (4) UC depleted. Overall, 40 annotated-modules were IBD-relevant by this definition and also contained standards for which chemical taxonomy was available (Fig. 3A). Most modules were found to predominantly contain either depleted or enriched metabolic features (Fig. 3A). All modules contained features that were significantly perturbed in both CD-dysbiosis and UC, in agreement with their expected commonalities in pathogenesis and manifestation (Fig. 3A). CD-dysbiosis and UC shared seven depleted and one enriched modules, and we did not detect any modules that were enriched in one IBD subtype and depleted in the other.

In total, 43 chemical subclasses were associated with the IBD-relevant modules, spanning multiple biological processes (Fig. 3A). In agreement with previous studies of identified compounds (Franzosa et al, 2019), subclasses such as amino acids, peptides, and analogs, bile acids, and fatty acids and conjugates occurred in both enriched and depleted modules. However, a large majority of subclasses, including nucleosides, vitamins, steroids, medium-chain hydroxy acids, and carboximidic acids, were unique to one category of differential abundance. We assessed the ecological properties of these features, noting that all modules contained unidentified features that were at least 10% as abundant as the co-clustered standard (AVA ≥ 0.1) (Fig. 3B). Further, 28 (~70%) modules contained unidentified metabolic features that were more abundant (AVA &gt; 1) than the co-clustered standard. This provides the first piece of evidence that these unidentified features may be as or more bioactive in IBD than the standard itself, integrated with others by the remainder of the analysis method.

# Highly prioritized metabolites are chemically diverse, microbiome-linked, and include both known and less-explored bioactives

Prioritization of potentially bioactive metabolites in the IBD subtypes CD-dysbiosis and UC was performed using the meta-rank obtained by integrating percentile values of ranks from AVA, q value, and effect size in each subtype (see “Methods”). Thus, each of 37,201 prevalent features had two meta-ranks or “priority scores”, one for each IBD subtype. In each subtype, features with priority scores in the 90th percentile (i.e., ≥ 0.731 in CD-dysbiosis and ≥0.738 in UC) and priority score ≥0.9 were considered to be highly prioritized and very highly prioritized, respectively, in that subtype (Dataset EV7). In total, 312 modules contained at least one highly prioritized (priority score ≥0.75) feature, 222 of which were common between the subtypes. These modules included 960 features highly prioritized in both subtypes (58 of these were very highly prioritized), which themselves included both enriched and depleted metabolites, e.g., bile acids, and biotin linked to anti-inflammatory pathways (Chen et al, 2019; Skupsky et al, 2020), and the IBD biomarkers -acylcarnitines and hippurate (Smith et al, 2021; Williams et al, 2010) (Fig. 4A).
