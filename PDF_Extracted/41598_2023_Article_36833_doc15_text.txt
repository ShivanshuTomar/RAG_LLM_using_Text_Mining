formerly known as MDX-1100), a human monoclonal antibody against CXCL10, has reportedly been developed and has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of RA and IBD 63,64.

biota, and mucosal locations may play a causative role in the onset of RA2,65,66. Considering that the human intestinal microflora is affected by many factors such as region, population, host genetic factors, environment, and diet and different diseases may have different microbial flora, this study aimed to examine the relationship between the intestinal microflora in only one RA dataset and identify shared specific genes between IBD and RA. In the original study of the PRJEB6997 dataset, the abundance of Lactobacillus salivarius, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides was found to be high and that of Haemophilus, Klebsiella, and Bifidobacteria was found to be low in patients with RA 45. In this study, the abundance of Prevotella was high and that of Ruminococcus and Ruminococcus bromii was low in patients with RA. It’s reported that the abundance of Prevotella copri was higher in stool samples of individuals with untreated new-onset RA (between 6 weeks and 6 months after diagnosis), and its presence was associated with a decline in the abundance of Bacteroides species and a loss of purportedly beneficial microbes 2. Ruminococcus species can suppress TNF-α, and its abundance is lower in patients with Crohn’s disease than in healthy individuals 67,68. On the contrary, Ruminococcus and Ruminococcus bromii are less reported in RA. In this study, data extracted from the gutMGene and STITCH databases revealed some metabolites associated with Ruminococcus, and succinate found in Ruminococcus champanellensis 18P13(T) had a direct relationship with CXCL10. A crucial metabolite in both host and microbial activities is succinate. Although succinate is typically considered an intermediate, it gets accumulated in some pathological conditions, especially during inflammation and metabolic stress 69. Succinate was considered a pro-inflammatory metabolite; however, a study showed that it exerts anti-inflammatory effects on inflammatory signaling in macrophages 70.

CXCL10 was significantly linked with the invasion of M1 macrophages in both RA and UC. Macrophages play an important role in RA. They are commonly found at the cartilage–pannus junction and in inflammatory synovial membranes. The extensive proinflammatory, destructive, and remodeling abilities of macrophages play an important role in both acute and chronic phases of RA 71. TNF-α and interleukin-1 are two pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by M1 macrophages, and several experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated their importance in the pathophysiology of RA72,73. Additionally, macrophages have been associated with IBD because they play a crucial role in several IBD-related risk genes74,75. Macrophages are regionally concentrated and polarize to the M1 subtype in UC, leading to persistent and recurrent inflammation 76–78.

Although this study had a relatively large sample size (GEO and GMrepo datasets), certain limitations should be noted. Clinical samples should be used to validate these findings. Owing to clinical research and ethical constraints, the present study was not completely rigorous. Moreover, this study focused on the relationship between intestinal microbiota and genes. However, it is challenging to collect or monitor the intestinal microbiota of a single patient at the same time, as the intestinal microbiota may change owing to various factors such as environmental change or growth and development. The use of microarray technology to evaluate gene expression presents another drawback. Since fluorescence-mediated gene expression assessment is a biased method in contrast to hypothesis-free sequencing technology, RNA sequencing is more frequently used for assessing broad gene expression than microarray. Furthermore, even if we attempted to eliminate the batch impact of the combined data using the combat function of the sva package, it is undeniable that any solution can only mitigate this effect. These important issues should be considered in future studies.

In conclusion, because CXCL10 is involved in the onset of RA and IBD, it can be used to diagnose these two conditions. In addition, the gut microbiome in RA and several pathways related to IBD and RA were also found to be regulated by CXCL10. The findings of this study revealed the mechanism underlying the association between RA and IBD and served as a reference for further investigation of the intestinal flora in RA.
