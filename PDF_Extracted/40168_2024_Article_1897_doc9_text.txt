# DNA extractions and compositional profiling by 16S metagenomic sequencing

The total genomic DNA was extracted from 200 mg of stool or from pellets of 1 mL culture (centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C), using the Maxwell®RSC PureFood GMO and Authentication Kit. The quality of all DNA extracts was confirmed on a Tris-Acetate-EDTA (TAE)-1.5 % agarose gel. The total DNA concentration after extraction was quantified using the Qubit®dsDNA HS Assay kit. We performed amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region on Illumina MiSeq (2x 300 bp) using the primer combination 341F (5′-CCTACGGGN-BGCASCAG-3′) and 806bR (5′-GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′). Library preparation and sequencing was performed by StarSEQ GmbH (Mainz, Germany) with 25 % PhiX. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were inferred using Dada2 v1.18.0. Forward and reverse reads shorter than 250 and 210 were filtered. The maximum number of expected errors was set to 4 and 5 for forward and reverse reads, respectively. Inference was performed in “pseudo pool” mode. Read pairs were merged with a minimum overlap of 20, and chimeras were removed using the “consensus” method. After processing, the median number of reads per sample was 22,716 with an IQR of 17,937–27,904. Taxonomic annotation was done with the RDP classifier of Dada2 using the GTDB r95 database.

# Succinate‑specific enrichment

We first determined the genus-level composition of each of the succinate supplemented (SU) and non-supplemented (SU–) enrichment cultures based on 16S amplicon sequencing. To this end, we computed the regularized genus-level relative abundance by grouping all ASVs that were taxonomically classified as the same genus and normalizing the genus-specific read counts by the total read count in the sample after adding a pseudo-count of 1 if a specific genus had at least one count in the fecal sample or any derived enrichment culture. Note that in a Bayesian interpretation, the pseudo-count of 1 corresponds to a flat Dirichlet prior in a Dirichlet-Multinomial model for read counts. To account for unspecific growth, we determined maximum regularized relative abundance of a genus in the SU– enrichments. We defined the succinate-specific enrichment as the difference in regularized relative abundance of the genus in the SU cultures minus the unspecific growth.

We tested for associations of genera with succinate consumption categories of the fecal microbiota using a statistical approach. We first filtered for those genera for which the maximum succinate enrichment across all enrichments was at least 0.01, yielding 35 out of a total of 292 genera. With these 35 genera, we then performed a joint linear regression of the enrichment score on the interaction of consumption category, day, and genus with no intercept. This tests, for each combination genus, category, and day, whether the succinate enrichment is statistically different from zero. We then selected those genera with p < 0.05 and an estimated mean larger than zero. Using this approach we identified the four genera Phascolarctobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium_A, Dialister, and Flavonifractor.

# Identification of the mmdA gene and succinate pathway

The goal was to broadly identify putative succinate consumers based on the similarity to the mmdA gene of the Veillonella parvula succinate-to-propionate cluster (UniProt Q57079). We first looked for putative hits in all translated genomes from GTDB release 214 with phmmer (HMMER 3.3) and filtered for those with an e-value below 10−150, resulting in 1643 distinct genomes. For each genus, we kept only the hit with the lowest e-value, leaving 281 distinct genera. We then performed multiple sequence alignment with MAFFT including the human PCCB gene to use as a phylogenetic outgroup. Finally, we reconstructed the phylogeny of mmdA genes using RAxML-NG with a JTT+G model, 10 maximum parsimony starting trees, and 200 bootstraps. For representative genomes of the four succinate utilizers (GCA_000160055.1, GCA_003945365.1, GCA_010508875.1, GCA_023497905.1), we identified the succinate-to-propionate gene cluster using gutSMASH.

# Testing of isolates for succinate consumption

Strains were pre-cultured in M2GSC medium, with the exception of Akkermansia muciniphila DSMZ 22959 that was pre-cultured in M2-based medium supplemented with 3 g/L of type II mucin (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland) and Veillonella parvula DSMZ 2008 that was pre-cultured in M2-based medium supplemented with 60mM of DL-lactic acid 90% (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland). To test for succinate consumption, we inoculated 0.1 mL of 48 h pre-cultures into 8 mL of M2-based medium supplemented with 30 mM or 80 mM of succinate and quantified the succinate concentrations after 2 and 7 days.
