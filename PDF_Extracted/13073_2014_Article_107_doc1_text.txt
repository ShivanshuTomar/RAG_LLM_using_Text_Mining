# Background

Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have long been known to have genetic risk factors due to increased prevalence in relatives of affected individuals as well as higher concordance rates for disease among monozygotic versus dizygotic twins. The sequencing of the human genome and subsequent large-cohort genetic studies has revealed a complex set of polymorphisms conferring varying levels of risk. Extensive analyses of these loci revealed that impaired handling of commensal microbes and pathogens is a prominent factor in disease development [1]. For example, genetically driven impaired function of NOD2 in the sensing of bacterial products like lipopolysaccharide may cause an increase in bacteria that produce those products. Involvement of the JAK-STAT pathway in immune responses, and involvement of the IL-23-Th17 pathway in microbial defense mechanisms, are also possible links between impaired immune response and imbalances in bacterial assemblage [1-3]. These genetic findings are in line with separate, independent tests of microbial shifts associated with IBD. Shifts in taxonomic composition and metabolic capabilities of the IBD microbiome are both now beginning to be defined [4-9]. Determining the extent and nature of host genome-microbiome associations in IBD is an important next step in understanding the mechanisms of pathogenesis. Despite the documented independent associations of IBD with heritable host immune deficiencies and with microbial shifts, there has been limited study of the co-association of complex host genetic factors with microbial composition and metabolism in IBD patients or other populations [9-17], and the mechanisms of host-microbiome disease pathways are largely unknown.

Using three independent cohorts comprising 474 adult human subjects with IBD aged 18 to 75 years, we tested known IBD-associated host genetic loci for enrichment of association with gut microbiome taxonomic composition. Cohorts were located near Boston (USA), Toronto (Canada), and Groningen (the Netherlands), with 152, 160, and 162 subjects, respectively. The cohorts contained 62.5%, 14.3%, and 63.5% CD cases with the remainder cases of UC, and 31.5%, 11.3%, and 53.1% biopsies from inflamed sites, respectively (detailed summary statistics by cohort and biopsy location in Figures S1 and S2 in Additional file 1). The Toronto cohort contained 70.6% biopsies from the pre-pouch ileum in subjects with previous ileo-anal pouch surgery; all remaining samples were from the colon and terminal ileum, with 73.0%, 18.1%, and 87.0% from the colon in the three cohorts, respectively. We excluded all subjects that had taken antibiotics within one month prior to sampling. We obtained genotyping with Illumina Immunochip assays [18] and 16S rRNA gene sequences as described previously [19] (SNP prevalence by cohort in Additional file 2). We rarefied bacterial microbiome samples to an even sequencing depth of 2,000 sequences per sample to control for differential sequencing effort across cohorts. This rarefaction depth allows us to observe taxa with relative abundance as low as 0.15% with 95% confidence in each sample (binomial distribution with 2,000 trials and probability 0.0015). We report a pathway-level analysis of complex functional associations between host genetics and overall microbiome composition, as well as a targeted analysis of the association of NOD2 with specific bacterial taxa.

# Methods

# Ethics and consent

This study was approved by the Partners Human Research Committee, 116 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA, USA. Patients gave informed consent to participate in the study. This study conformed to the Helsinki Declaration and to local legislation.

# Data collection and generation

We genotyped subjects using the Immunochip platform as described previously [18], excluding polymorphisms with minor allele frequency of 0.1 or below from subsequent testing. 16S rRNA genes were extracted and amplified from intestinal biopsies and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using published methods [20]. These procedures include extraction using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with minor alterations described in prior work [20], followed by amplification using the 16S variable region 4 forward primer GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA and reverse primer GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT, followed by barcoded multiplexing and sequencing. Only one biopsy was used per subject; when multiple biopsies were available we selected the non-inflamed biopsy first.

# Data processing

We extracted risk allele counts for 163 published genetic risk loci for CD, UC, and IBD [1]. When combining data from separate Immunochip runs we tested for strand inversions by linkage disequilibrium with neighboring variants using plink [21]. Microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and their taxonomic assignments were obtained using default settings in QIIME version 1.8 [22] by reference-mapping at 97% similarity against representative sequences of 97% OTU in Greengenes (taxa version 4feb2011; metagenome version 12_10) [23]. We used all default settings in QIIME 1.8 for OTU mapping, and we used the pre-assigned taxonomy for the Greengenes OTU representative sequences. Samples were rarefied to an even sequence depth of 2,000 sequences per sample to control for varied sequencing depth. Taxa were collapsed into clusters with >0.95 Pearson’s correlation to remove.
