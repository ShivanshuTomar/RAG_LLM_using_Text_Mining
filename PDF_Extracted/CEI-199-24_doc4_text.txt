mediate their effects in treating IBD through potentially up-regulating anti-inflammatory immune pathways. Results in clinical trials in IBD have been mixed, with meta-analyses only showing benefit in modest prevention of relapse only for UC when used in conjunction with 5-aminosalicylic acids and moderate-quality evidence highlighting its role in the prevention of pouchitis [81,82].

One of the probable reasons for the lack of success with antibiotics and probiotics is that these approaches tend to assume that microbial triggers for IBD follow Koch’s postulates, and attempt an untargeted change of the underlying dysbiosis. However, if we assume that the underlying mechanism stimulating IBD is a shift in the gut microbial community towards an ecosystem that induces and maintains host proinflammatory pathways, then re-establishing this community towards a ‘healthy’ population of microbes should, in effect, restore immunological homeostasis. FMT is the transfer of a processed stool obtained from a healthy donor into a patient with the aim of correcting the underlying dysbiosis by attempting to restore the intestinal microbial community [83,84]. FMT has proved to be highly successful in treating recurrent and antibiotic refractory Clostridiodes difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI), with cure rates approaching 90% [85]. Unlike IBD, the mechanisms of disease in CDI are better understood where toxins and other putative virulence factors produced by C. difficile are responsible for the pathogenicity [86].

The obvious success of FMT in CDI has resulted in the exploration of its use in treatment of IBD. Four randomized controlled trials and a multitude of case reports have been completed to date, primarily evaluating the efficacy of FMT in UC. A meta-analysis of the four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has demonstrated that clinical remission was achieved in 39 of 140 (28%) patients in the donor FMT groups compared with 13 of 137 (9%) patients in the placebo groups (P < 0·01) [87]. There was marked variability in the designs of each of these four clinical trials, ranging from differences in the route of administration of FMT [upper gastrointestinal (GI) versus lower GI, fresh versus frozen], the total number of FMTs administered (two to 40 infusions), FMT preparation (anaerobic versus aerobic) and differences in definition of primary outcomes. Consequently, the clinical remission rates varied widely, from 24 to 50% in the FMT arm.

# Immunological mechanistic insights for FMT from clinical studies in IBD

A considerable amount of mechanistic work that was incorporated into both the clinical trials and cohort studies primarily focused on changes in the recipient gut microbial and metabolomic profiles and its relationship with clinical outcomes, with little consideration of the host biological response. A general theme of an increased α-diversity or richness in the microbiome and a shift of recipient microbial profiles towards those of donors were observed, with some studies suggesting that colonization by specific donor-derived taxa was associated with clinical benefit [88]. However, immunological consequences of FMT in IBD have been very poorly described. Immunophenotyping of LPMC and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients recruited in the RCT conducted by Costello and colleagues was described in supplementary data [89]. They failed to find any significant change in proportions of γδ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and T cells (including subsets: memory, CD4, CD8 or Tregs) in LPMCs as a result of FMT. Interestingly, however, on analysis of PBMCs they found a slight increase in gut-homing CD4 T cells (defined as CD4+CD45RO+β7+) following FMT, which was only just significant (P = 0·05) when adjusted for clinical disease activity scores. The gut-homing Treg subset in PBMCs, however, did not change post-FMT. A detailed methodology used for cell isolation and immunophenotyping (including representative gating strategy) was not described. It also was not clear whether any shifts in immune subsets were seen in those who responded to FMT compared to those who did not. Analysis of immunological changes was not explored in any of the other three published randomized controlled trials.

There are more than 40 case–series exploring the efficacy of FMT in IBD, only a handful of which have reported immunology outcomes. A pilot study of 19 patients with active CD demonstrated an increase in the proportion of colonic mucosal Tregs (defined as CD4+CD25+CD127lo) 12 weeks after a single colonic infusion of FMT [90]. The change was not different in responders compared to non-responders (mean 5 versus +CD39+CD161+). A study of 19 patients with moderate to severe UC failed to show a change in a large panel of serum cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-17 following a single upper GI infusion of FMT regardless of clinical response [91]. An open-label pilot of a single FMT delivery by colonoscopy in 20 patients with active UC revealed a decrease in colonic mucosal Th1 and Treg cells, with no difference in the Th17 cell population post-FMT [92]. Seven patients in this study achieved clinical remission; however, a subgroup analysis of mucosal immunophenotype in these responders was not presented. A case–series that failed to show a beneficial clinical response in eight patients with chronic pouchitis after a single intragastric dose of FMT also, perhaps not surprisingly, failed to demonstrate any change in lamina propria dendritic cell phenotype and cytokine profiles [93]. A seminal study that incorporated an open-label pilot of FMT explored the role of bacteriophages in altering mucosal immune responses. In this study, 20 patients with active UC treated with a single colonoscopic infusion of FMT.
