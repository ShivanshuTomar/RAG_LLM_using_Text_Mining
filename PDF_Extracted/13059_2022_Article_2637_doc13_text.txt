# identify taxonomy up to the strain levels and the bacteria associated metabolic pathways and functions

All studies selected were based on the same region (V4), which limits the number of available studies. We included a single sample per subject and no longitudinal data, and there may be variations in microbial population overtime that are not captured [52]. However, we and others have shown persistent dysbiosis also in CD and UC patients in remission [1, 55]. While we were able to capture IBD-specific bacteria, using the same approach to identify other disease-specific signals failed, likely due to lack of sufficient studies linked with other diseases. Future analysis will require more disease-specific studies and increased data sharing, as well as additional large population-based studies like UK Twins and the American Gut Project (AGP).

# Conclusions

Despite numerous studies linking the microbiome to human health and disease conditions, there are many gaps regarding which and how those bacteria contribute to specific human disorders. In this meta-analysis, we identified a robust non-specific general response dominated by reduction of microbial ASVs with a smaller group of bacteria that were up-regulated in a large array of diseases. Those non-specific taxa can define a novel universal dysbiosis index (UniDI) that can successfully differentiate between most cases and controls across a wide variety of diseases. Finally, we identified mainly increased IBD-specific taxa, potentially indicating a more direct causal association to pathogenesis and gut inflammation, that can be used as biomarkers and potential future targets for interventions.

# Methods

# Study search and disease cohort selection strategy

We searched for case–control (disease cohort) 16S amplicon sequencing studies using specific keywords in Google Scholar and dbBact (http://dbbact.org/) and by following references in meta-analyses and related case–control studies. Only studies with at least 20 subjects, with stool or biopsies samples that were sequenced using hypervariable V4 region, and for which the per-sample raw FASTA files were publicly available for download or obtained after a specific request, were included. Those studies and sources are summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1. Only one sample per patient was kept in cases where several samples were obtained. In studies that had UC/CD patients, we considered each disease as a separate disease cohort and randomly divided the controls between the two case-control comparisons. In this meta-analysis, we included two large cohorts with multiple diseases: the UK Twins cohort (https://twinsuk.ac.uk/) and the American Gut Project (AGP) cohort (http://humanfoodproject.com/americangut/). In cases where controls were not defined (such as in the AGP and UK twins), we considered controls as those having BMI < 30 and not taking oral medications other than supplements and vitamins. Controls were then randomly divided (taking into account age, gender, and country of origin when applicable) between the different disease cohorts in each study, so that each control sample participated only in one disease cohort. To define obesity, subjects with BMI 30 or greater were included in the obesity group.
