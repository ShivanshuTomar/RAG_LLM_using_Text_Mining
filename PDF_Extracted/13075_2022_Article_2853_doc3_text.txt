It has been well established that the gut microbiome of AS and IBD patients are significantly different to healthy controls. However, it is less clear whether the AS and IBD microbiomes differ from each other. Utilizing a combination of stool samples and biopsies of the terminal ileal, colonic and rectal mucosae collected from 33 AS patients (including 5 with concomitant IBD, ‘AS-IBD’), 59 IBD patients, and 105 controls, significant differences in beta diversity between AS patients and healthy controls, as well as IBD patients and healthy controls were reconfirmed (Fig. 1A, B). Also consistent with previous results [5, 24] the alpha diversity of the microbiome of AS patients was the same as healthy controls, whereas IBD patients exhibited a significant depletion of bacterial diversity (Fig. 1C). AS patients with concomitant IBD (‘AS-IBD’) also exhibited reduced alpha diversity compared to AS patients, as well a significantly different microbiome composition (beta diversity) compared to both AS patients and IBD patients. A list of the specific bacterial genera associated with AS, AS-IBD and IBD in the most relevant sample types (terminal ileum and stool) is available in Supplementary Table 1 (p < 0.05). The detection of IBD using the findings from the stool microbiome of AS patients was achievable with moderate accuracy (AUC=0.754, 95% CI = 0.588–0.920), similar to the performance of faecal calprotectin (FCP) (AUC=0.752) and better than the DISQ (AUC=0.716). The stool microbiome also accurately distinguished IBD patients from healthy controls (AUC=0.757, 95% CI = 0.643–0.871) (Fig. 1D).

The composition of the AS microbiome detectable in stool was also compared across three geographic regions, Australia, Italy and Sweden (Fig. 2). As expected, significant differences in both alpha and beta diversity were observed, with AS patients from each region demonstrating unique microbiome composition. Furthermore, Swedish AS patients exhibited a less diverse microbiome overall (alpha diversity). A list of the bacterial taxa enriched or depleted in Italian and Swedish samples, relative to Australian samples is available in Supplementary Table 2. Whilst the sample collection, handling and sequencing, and bioinformatic.
