# Abstract

Microbiome studies of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have achieved a scale for meta-analysis of dysbioses among populations. To enable microbial community meta-analyses generally, we develop MMUPHin for normalization, statistical meta-analysis, and population structure discovery using microbial taxonomic and functional profiles. Applying it to ten IBD cohorts, we identify consistent associations, including novel taxa such as Acinetobacter and Turicibacter, and additional exposure and interaction effects.

A single gradient of dysbiosis severity is favored over discrete types to summarize IBD microbiome population structure. These results provide a benchmark for characterization of IBD and a framework for meta-analysis of any microbial communities.

# Background

Meta-analysis for molecular epidemiology in large populations has seen great success in linking high-dimensional ‘omic features to complex health-related phenotypes. One example of this is in genome-wide association studies (GWAS [1]), where the appropriate study scale, achieved by rigorous integration of multiple cohorts, has both facilitated reproducible discoveries (in the form of disease-associated loci [2–4]) and addressed confounding due to unobserved population structure [5]. The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) represent a particular success story for GWAS meta-analysis [3, 4], and environmental and microbial contributors complementing the condition’s complex genetic architecture have been detailed by many individual studies [6–8]. However, in the absence of methods appropriate for large-scale microbial meta-analysis, the extent to which these findings reproduce across studies, or can be extended by increased joint.
