The neurotransmitter serotonin, tryptophan can also be degraded in the gut through the kynurenine and serotonin synthesis pathways. This degradation can affect its availability to pass the blood–brain barrier. Thus, by modulating tryptophan levels, microbiota can affect the brain, resulting in behavioral changes [29].

By fermentation of dietary fibers, the gut microbiota is also responsible for producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid, which are typically found to be reduced in mucosa and feces of patients with IBD [30]. As extensively reviewed by Parada Venegas et al. [31], these metabolic products have shown to play an important role in promoting epithelial cell proliferation [32], barrier function [33], and cellular metabolism [34]. In addition, SCFAs have been involved in controlling intestinal inflammation through activation of G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways [35], thereby regulating intestinal homeostasis and inhibiting pathogen colonization. Relevantly, SCFAs are also known to exert neuroprotective properties. For instance, gamma-aminobutyric acid is an inhibitory neurotransmitter involved in anxiety and depression and can therefore modulate behavior [36]. Other mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota affect neural responses include alterations in bacterial neurometabolites or bacterial cell wall sugars. These products can either act directly on primary afferent axons or trigger epithelial cells to release molecules that modulate neural signaling within the ENS [28].

Altogether, the multifaceted interplay between the gut, microbiota, and brain allows for intestinal and extraintestinal homeostasis, thereby coordinating gastrointestinal functions and modulating mood and higher cognitive functions, respectively.

# 4. Gut/Microbiota/Brain Interplay in IBD Development

It has become evident that factors such as genetics, environment, diet, and lifestyle are involved in dysregulation of the gut/microbiota/brain interplay, which in this section, will be discussed in the context of IBD development (Figure 1 and Table 1) [37,38].

To date, genome-wide association studies revealed more than 200 susceptibility gene loci in IBD [39–43]. First, based on a model selection analysis, 163 susceptibility gene loci were identified, of which 23 and 30 loci were shown to be specific for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, respectively [39]. These data were further completed with a more recent association study identifying 38 novel risk loci [40]. Based on another large genetic association study in IBD patients, it was shown that ten single nucleotide polymorphisms, in a total of four genes, were found to be significantly correlated with Crohn’s disease [41]. Strongest correlations were found with CYLD, a de-ubiquitinating enzyme, pointing towards the ubiquitin proteasome system as a major contributor to IBD pathogenesis [41]. A more recent and very large study of 34,819 IBD patients investigating genotype–phenotype associations across 156,154 genetic variants also provided important insights into the genetic heterogeneity between ileal and colonic Crohn’s disease, thereby rejecting the current classification of Crohn’s disease versus ulcerative colitis [42].

In addition to genetics, the association between non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms and IBD risk has gained major interest [44]. Moreover, based on several twin studies, the importance of non-genetic environmental factors [45,46] on IBD disease manifestation has become clear. One example is the implication of micronutrients in IBD progression. Patients with IBD are commonly diagnosed with a vitamin D deficiency [47], which can be related to lowered oral intake of vitamin D or decreased sunlight exposure. A more recent study in healthy volunteers showed that, specifically, the gut microbiome of the upper gastrointestinal tract is positively influenced in response to vitamin D3 treatment [48], suggesting that vitamin D plays a protective role in IBD pathogenesis. Alternatively, intracellular levels of zinc [49] and iron [50] have been associated with bacterial clearance and consequent intestinal permeability and increased risk of IBD, respectively.
