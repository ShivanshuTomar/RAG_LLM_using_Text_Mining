# Participants

# Inclusion criteria

- People with active UC (Mayo score 4–10) being treated with standard-of-care therapy (5-ASAs, corticosteroids, thiopurines) who achieved clinical remission (Mayo score ≤ 2, with each subscore ≤ 1) after 7 sessions of colonoscopic FMT and were on stable dosing of medications (5-ASA and azathioprine for 6 months)

# Exclusion criteria

- People with proctitis (E1 disease) and receiving topical 5-ASAs

# Interventions

# Experimental arm

n = 31

- Single donor feces; 100 g stool in 200 mL infusion, administered via colonoscopy at weeks 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48

# Control arm

n = 30

- Placebo consisting of preservative-free normal saline with added food grade color; in 200 mL infusion, administered via colonoscopy at weeks 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48

# Outcomes

# Primary outcome

- Maintenance of steroid-free clinical remission at week 48 (Mayo score ≤ 2, all subscores ≤ 1)

# Secondary outcomes

- Endoscopic remission at week 48 (Endoscopic Mayo score 0)
- ESR and CRP at week 48
- Adverse events

# Notes

Data extraction: the breakdown of adverse events was extracted with the assumption that 1 event occurred per participant. We only extracted data on clinical and endoscopic remission rates, adverse events, withdrawals, ESR, and CRP during the maintenance period.

Data interpretation: study authors used an ITT approach, in which it appeared that all randomized participants received ≥ 1 study dose and were considered in the final analysis, even though some participants were lost to follow-up over the course of the maintenance period.

Funding: none.

# Risk of bias

|Bias|Authors' judgement|Support for judgement|
|---|---|---|
|Random sequence generation (selection bias)|Low risk|Quote: "Eligible patients who consented were then randomised in a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomisation list, to receive either FMT or placebo by a colonoscopic route every 8 weeks, for a further 48 weeks." (page 1312)|
|Allocation concealment (selection bias)|Unclear risk|Comment: the paper did not specifically mention allocation concealment.|
|Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)|Low risk|Quote: "Both patients and treating physicians were blinded to the nature of intervention done." (page 1312)|
