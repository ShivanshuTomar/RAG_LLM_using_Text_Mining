# Possible Mechanisms whereby Metabolite-Sensing GPCRs Exerts an Anti-Inflammatory Effect in the Gut</h8>
A general model on how metabolite-sensing GPCRs may impact IBD is shown in Figure 2. The primary two anti-inflammatory mechanisms by which metabolite-sensing GPCRs maintain intestinal homeostasis include: (1) regulation of the gut epithelium and (2) promotion of both innate and adaptive intestinal immunity.

Metabolites are produced by the microbiota and also host cells in the gut. Metabolite-sensing G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are highly expressed in intestinal immune and nonimmune cells that recognized microbiota-derived metabolites. Activation of these metabolite-sensing GPCRs promotes intestinal homeostasis through enhancing the intestinal epithelial barrier (activation of inflammasome, increasing the expression level of tight junction proteins, promotion of intestinal stem cells and secretion of antimicrobial peptides), decreasing the production of the inflammatory cytokines, reducing the cell infiltrates and activation of regulatory T cells (adapted from SERVIER MEDICAL ART (CC of license 3.0)).

# 8.1. Metabolite-Sensing GPCRs Enhance Epithelial Integrity</h8>
The inflammasome and the secretion of IL-18 are some of the critical mechanisms by which intestinal epithelial homeostasis is maintained [162â€“164]. In this regard, mice lacking NLRP3 exacerbated colitis in the DSS model [162,163]. However, the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in colitis is controversial. Indeed, hyper-activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can lead to colitis in different contexts [165]. In a mouse model of colitis, SCFAs decreased the severity of colitis by activating NLRP3 as well as IL-18 secretion through GPR43 and GPR109A [51,57]. The uses of bone marrow chimera model by Macia et al. [51] showed that the beneficial effect of GPR43 is related to its expression in epithelial cells. It has been reported that Ca2+ [166,167] mobilization or K+ efflux can activate the inflammasome [168]. In this regard, induction of Ca2+ mobilization or K+ efflux upon activation of GPR43 or GPR109A may initiate activation of the inflammasome. However, this observation requires further investigations.

# Intestinal barrier</h8>
GWAS and animal studies have shown that the dysfunction of TJ in the intestine contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD [169,170] as the disruption of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin leads to an increase in intestinal permeability and a decrease in transepithelial resistance [171]. Multiple studies have evaluated the role of metabolite-sensing GPCRs in regulating the intestinal barrier. Indeed, the microbial metabolite linoleic acid (10-Hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid), ameliorates intestinal epithelial barrier impairment via GPR40-MEK-ERK pathway [112]. Recently, Shao et al. showed that the activation of GPR39 by zinc improves the epithelial integrity by enhancing the abundance of ZO-1 in S. typhimurium-infected Caco-2 cells [172]. Furthermore, the activation of GPR68 by an acidic extracellular environment improved barrier function, and inhibited cell migration and proliferation, during the in vitro model of wound healing in Caco-2 cells [173].
