# Statistical analysis

A total sample size of 24 was determined to have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.75 across four groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a two-tailed significance of 0.05 for the primary outcome of differences in IELs between study cohorts. Variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test; those data not normally distributed are presented in the figures using a logarithmic y-axis. Patient demographic comparisons were made using ANOVA or Fisher’s exact test to compare patients with CD, UC, and axSpA, and controls, except for medications, which were compared in the CD, UC, and axSpA groups only. The Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc analysis for pairwise comparisons of significant groups was used to evaluate differences in IEL phenotype and cytokine production. Linear regression was used to test correlation between IEL characteristics and continuous variables including CRP, WBC, duration of disease, disease activity scores, and age. Fisher’s exact test was utilized to test associations between IEL secretion and categorical variables such as sex, family history of autoimmunity, smoking history, diet, and TNF inhibitor (TNFi) use. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare relative abundance of OTUs between study groups. Spearman’s rank correlation was tested between OTUs and IEL changes that were found to be statistically significantly different between groups. Permutation-based multiple analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was conducted using the vegan R package (Bray-Curtis Method, 10,000 permutations). Community diversity was estimated by both the Shannon H index and Simpson inverse diversity indices. Chao1 was used to measure microbial richness and Good’s coverage was used to confirm the adequacy of sequencing coverage. All tests of significance were two-sided and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were conducted with the R and SPSS (version 22; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) statistical packages, while graphics were created using SPSS, GraphPad version 8.2 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA), and Excel Office Professional Plus 2013 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA).

# Results

# Baseline characteristics

A total of 38 subjects (15 controls, 10 patients with CD, 7 patients with UC, and 6 patients with axSpA) were recruited (Table 1). There were no significant differences in baseline basic demographic features (sex, ethnicity, smoking status, family history of autoimmunity). More patients with CD (50%) or axSpA (83%) were on TNF inhibitors (TNFi) compared to patients with UC (0%, p < 0.01). As expected, patients with axSpA (83%) were more likely to be HLA-B27-positive than patients with IBD (20%) or controls (0%, p = 0.0001). Patients with axSpA were noted to have significantly higher leukocyte counts than patients with IBD and controls (p = 0.02), although the increased leukocyte count was not outside the normal range determined by the clinical laboratory. Overall, subjects with IBD had long-established disease and low disease activity at the time of their endoscopy. Patients with axSpA also had long-established disease, moderate disease activity, and more TNFi use at the time of their endoscopy.

# IEL populations

The total number of IELs was significantly decreased in subjects with axSpA compared to those with IBD and controls (p = 0.03; Fig. 1a). When analyzed by T cell subsets, a decrease in T cell receptor (TCR)β+ IELs likely accounted for this difference (p = 0.06; Fig. 1b). There were trends toward reduced TCRβ+ subsets of CD4+ and CD8aa+ IELs (p = 0.074 and p = 0.030, respectively; Additional file 1: Figure S1A), but no significant differences between cohorts in total TCRγδ+ IELs (Fig. 1c) or in CD4+, CD4-CD8-, CD8αα+, and CD8αβ+ subsets of TCRγδ+ IELs (Additional file 1: Figure S1B). Nor were there significant differences between cohorts in the presence of cell markers CD44+, CD103+ (integrin αE, which mediates retention of the IEL at the epithelial surface [36]), or IL-23R (Additional file 1: Figure S1C-E). As the number of IELs could be influenced by the systemic level of lymphocytes, which were significantly higher in subjects with axSpA, we tested for correlation between IELs and peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte count in those with axSpA. To our surprise, we found strong, significant negative correlation between the peripheral lymphocyte count and IEL number in subjects with axSpA (ρ = − 0.94, R2 = 0.89, p = 0.0047; Fig. 1d). We did not, however, observe.
