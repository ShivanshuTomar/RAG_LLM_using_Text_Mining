# Fig. 1 Dynamics of longitudinal microbial composition and facultative anaerobic microbial profiles in inflammatory bowel disease.

a Individual microbial trajectories of 20 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and 11 control individuals with sufficient longitudinal data over time, from the current study (Massachusetts General Hospital, p-identifiers) and (Emory University, S-identifiers). Each subject exhibits an individualized microbiome signature. Each phylum has an overall color while genera are represented as different shades of the overall color.

b Maximal relative abundances of facultative anaerobes across all subjects in the LSS (n = 266), Lewis et al. (n = 368) [13], and HMP (n = 80) [15] cohorts. Overall, facultative anaerobes are significantly higher in IBD patients compared to controls (nested ANOVA LSS p = 0.0478, Lewis et al. p = 0.005)

and Veillonella species in IBD patients [13]. While we observed blooms of these species in a few patients with IBD trending in the same direction, these did not reach statistical significance in our cohort and test. Other differences included a lack of Bifidobacterium species in our study; both of these discrepancies with respect to the Gevers et al. [20] cohort may be due to a combination of age (20–66 years here, 3–17 years in Gevers et al.) and sample type (stool vs. predominantly biopsy) differences between the studies.

Of the nine-identified species that showed consistent differences in abundance between IBD patients and controls in both the LSS and the Lewis et al. cohorts, eight could be explained by their tolerance to oxidative stress. Two facultative anaerobes showed increased abundance in IBD patients (Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus parasanguinis), whereas six anaerobes showed decreased abundance in the IBD samples (including Blautia obeum and Alistipes putredinis; Additional file 3: Table S3). These findings are consistent with previous observations of enriched abundance of proteobacteria species in the IBD gut, as these species are facultative anaerobes. The one remaining differentially abundant species, which was not apparently explained by its tolerance to oxidative stress, was R. gnavus. Despite being classified as an anaerobe, R. gnavus was more abundant in IBD patients. Indeed, of all bacterial species, R. gnavus showed the greatest increased abundance in IBD patients compared to controls in both the LSS and Lewis et al. cohorts (Additional file 3: Table S3).

# R. gnavus transiently dominates the gut microbiome of IBD patients

We identified R. gnavus blooms in 8/20 and 26/86 individuals from the LSS and Lewis et al. cohorts, respectively (defining a bloom as greater than 5% relative abundance). R. gnavus clearly stands out among all differentially abundant species as dominating the gut microbiome of IBD patients. The maximum relative abundance of R. gnavus in IBD patients from the LSS and Lewis et al. cohorts was 41.6 and 69.5%, respectively, whereas the maximum relative abundance was only 2.44% across all controls from these cohorts and only 1.06% in healthy HMP participants (Fig. 2a).

Interestingly, the increased abundances of R. gnavus in IBD patients were transient—typically spanning only one or two time points (Fig. 2b). These transient increases were detected in patients from the three different clinical centers and are therefore unlikely to be a geographical anomaly. In subject 8808 from the LSS cohort, a bloom in R. gnavus corresponded with a peak in the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), a clinical measure of disease activity, but the overall correlation between HBI did not reach significance (Fig. 2c). Blooms of R. gnavus also corresponded with significant decreases of previously identified IBD-depleted species, including F. prausnitzii (q-value = 3.04e-10; full list in Additional file 4: Table S4). The longitudinal nature of our cohorts was critical for this discovery, as it is impossible to identify transient blooms from cross-sectional data.

# Aerotolerance classification of R. gnavus

The increased abundance of R. gnavus was surprising in light of its classification as an obligate anaerobe because the other species increased in the IBD gut were facultative anaerobes. Therefore, we sought to test the bacteria’s ability to survive or grow in the presence of oxygen in the lab. We tested the aerotolerance of R. gnavus ATCC 29149 (isolated from healthy human stool [21]) relative to a facultative anaerobe (E. coli) and a strict anaerobe that was considerably less abundant in IBD (E. elegans). We found that while it is unable to grow in the presence of oxygen, R. gnavus retained 106 viable cells after 1 h of atmospheric oxygen exposure and 104 viable cells after 3 h in the presence of oxygen (see “Methods”). In contrast, E. elegans was unable to tolerate atmospheric oxygen at all, falling below our limit of detection even after only 1 h of exposure. The increased tolerance of R. gnavus to atmospheric oxygen may contribute to its blooms in the IBD gut (Fig. 2d).

# R. gnavus strains represent two phylogenetically distinct clades

The presence of R. gnavus in healthy and control samples, albeit in a much lower abundance, made us consider whether it had different functionality when present in high abundance in IBD patients. Sequencing many strains of bacteria from the same species has revealed that different strains can have dramatically different functionality due to a large number of highly variable accessory genes.

First, we examined whether we could detect different strains of R. gnavus in our samples. One way to identify multiple strains would be to take a closer look at genes.
