# Dikhnah Alshehri, et al.: Gut microbiota in IBD therapy

However, although the global alterations in the gut microbial communities of patients with IBD have been recognized and the research so far has found associations between microbial factors and inflammation, it is important to emphasize that there are still no clear conclusions to be drawn [6].

The exact pathogenesis of IBD remains unclear, but it has been noted that IBD occurs as a result of complicated interactions between genetic predisposition, environmental factors (diet, antimicrobial usage, smoking, etc.), socio-economic development, and microbial colonization [7]. One of the most common causes for the development of IBD is the inappropriate perpetuation of innate and adaptive immune factors in response to environmental triggers. This excessive immune response causes disregulation of cytokines and chronic inflammation (Figure 1) [6,8].

In this review, we explored the microbiota patterns associated with healthy and IBD-affected intestines and the effect of current IBD therapies on the gut microbiota composition. Furthermore, we considered the potential new therapeutic approaches that can be used to overcome current treatment constraints.

# DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN GI MICROBIOTA

It is believed that in humans, the microbiota begins to co-evolve as a physiologic community consisting of distinct niches in different parts of the body immediately after birth, showing metabolic and antigenic diversity. Many studies have investigated this phenomenon, going so far as to detect microbes even in womb tissues [9,10]. Following delivery, the body is colonized by microorganisms, creating a uniquely structured microbiota based partly on life events, such as the mode of delivery, illness, antibiotics usage, diet, geographical location, and general lifestyle [10,11].

Microbial colonization is influenced by mode of delivery. During the first few days of life, infants that are vaginally delivered are highly colonized with members of the genus Lactobacillus (belonging to phylum Firmicutes) compared to infants delivered via cesarean section (C-section) owing to the high abundance of lactobacilli in the vaginal niche [12,13]. Microbial colonization of infants delivered by C-section is reduced and delayed, because they are deprived of contact with maternal vaginal microbiota, particularly of obligate anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium [14-16]; babies delivered by C-section are more likely to have immune-mediated disorders [17,18]. In terms of the GI tract, 75% of the stool microbiota of vaginally delivered babies are similar to their mothers’ stool microbiota, whereas in babies delivered by C-section this fraction is considerably lower (41%) [19]. Generally, the composition of the microbiota in the early stages of life has low diversity and is dominated by two phyla—Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria [10,20]. Starting from the first few months of life and up to the time of exposure to solid foods, a well-characterized range of stereotypic microbial structures appear in the intestinal feces, where the microbial diversity gradually increases. This suggests that microbial colonization is acquired from sources other than, or in addition to, what is inherited from family members [21]. By the end of the first 3 years of life, the diversity and functional capacities of the microbiota develop towards a distinctive adult-like microbial profile that comprises a temporal pattern unique to each individual.

Despite the relative stability of the gut microbiota in adulthood, it is predisposed to perturbation over time with respect to life events [22]. Therefore, descriptions of the adult microbiota as “stable” are not entirely accurate, owing to the ongoing coexistence of some local species [15,21]. Notably, microbiota in individuals over the age of 65 have shown to shift towards an increased proportion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, especially Clostridium cluster IV, compared to younger subjects, where cluster XIVa is more common [23]. However, in another study, the diversity of the microbiota of elderly individuals aged over 100 years was found to be significantly decreased in a cohort of patients, exhibiting profound specific variations, such as an expansion in the abundance of facultative anaerobes (e.g., Escherichia coli) and a re-arrangement of the profile of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers in particular butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) [24]. Lifestyle interactions, such as community-dwelling and long-standing residential care, are the main factors that affect the diversity and composition of microbiota in elderly populations [25]. Furthermore, the overall metabolic
