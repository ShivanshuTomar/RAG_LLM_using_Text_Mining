# 3.2. Effects of High-Salt Diet on Intestinal Microbiota Metabolites in Cardiovascular Disease

Consequently, alterations in these bacterial species result in corresponding modifications in their bacterial-associated functions, which not only facilitate intestinal inflammatory responses, but also impede the inhibitory effects on hypertension.

In addition to directly influencing the composition of the gut microbiota, an elevated salt consumption can also exert an indirect effect on salt absorption pathways, including the sodium-proton exchanger-3 (NHE-3). The absence of NHE-3 can result in alterations in the gut microbiological environment and a decrease in blood pressure [46]. Furthermore, a high-salt diet increases the expression of NHE3 at the apical or basolateral membranes in the intestine [47]. In light of these findings, it seems reasonable to posit that a high salt intake may lead to an increase in NHE3, which could, in turn, result in a greater absorption of salt, particularly sodium, as well as alterations in the abundance of gut microbes and an overall rise in blood pressure. Furthermore, a review by Masenga et al. posits that dietary salt may indirectly exacerbate the risk of heart failure by modulating the gut microbiota and contributing to hypertension [48]. In conclusion, a high salt intake can affect the gut microbiology, which, in turn, can lead to hypertension. This alteration in blood pressure can further contribute to heart failure to some extent.

In conclusion, the findings of these studies indicate that an elevated salt consumption influences the gut microbiota, which may, consequently, affect cardiovascular health. It is of the utmost importance to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between salt intake, the gut microbiota, and cardiovascular disease in order to develop effective strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications associated with a high salt intake.

As previously discussed, an elevated salt intake has been shown to influence the composition of various functional gut microorganisms, which, in turn, has been linked to an increased risk of associated cardiovascular disease. Concurrently, a substantial body of research has elucidated the impact of an elevated salt intake on the composition and function of the gut microbiome, and the roles of these alterations in the pathogeneses of associated diseases.

The microbial products most closely associated with the effects of high dietary salt are SCFAs. SCFAs have been demonstrated to serve as a fuel source for the heart in cases of heart failure, thereby enhancing cardiac function. Additionally, they have been shown to exert a protective effect against systemic hypertension and left-sided heart lesions [49, 50]. As previously discussed, an elevated salt consumption results in alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota, notably a decline in the prevalence of Lactobacillus, which is known to produce anti-inflammatory mediators, including SCFAs. It can be postulated that a diet high in salt will result in a reduction in the levels of SCFAs, which may, in turn, exacerbate the symptoms experienced by patients with heart failure. In addition, these SCFAs have been demonstrated to increase the production of anti-inflammatory gut hormones in enteroendocrine cells, including GLP-1 and GLP-2 [51], which are both known for beneficial effects against cardiovascular disease [52, 53].

In a hypertension model induced by a high-salt diet in Wistar rats, Yan X. et al. observed that the levels of Bacteroides fragilis and its metabolite arachidonic acid in the intestine were reduced by the high-salt diet [28]. This resulted in an increase in intestinal-derived corticosterone production and corticosterone levels in the serum and intestine, which, in turn, promoted an elevation in blood pressure. Additionally, in a rat model, Zheng et al. demonstrated that a high-salt diet can induce the hypertension of liver-Yang hyperactivity syndrome, primarily through its impact on amino acids and their derivative metabolisms [54]. Notably, Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was down-regulated in a high-salt diet, which altered the GABA metabolic pathways, promoting hypertension and leading to an increased blood pressure, while glutamate and its derivatives were up-regulated.

In conclusion, studies show that the effects of a high-salt diet on gut microbial metabolites, particularly SCFAs, can have a direct effect on changes in blood pressure and, thus, cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, studies explicitly identifying the effects of specific.
