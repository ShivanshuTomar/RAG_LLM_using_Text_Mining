Whereas several studies demonstrated that psychotherapy had a beneficial impact on anxiety [157], depression [158], and quality of life of IBD patients [159], other studies were not able to find any effect [160, 161]. Yet, two other studies investigated the impact of combining a variety of techniques as a treatment option in IBD [161, 162]. Indeed, when combining relaxation with guided imagery, a method focusing on mind-relaxing images to replace stressful thoughts, both anxiety status and quality of life appeared to be improved among patients with IBD [163]. Similarly, multi-convergent therapy, which combines mindfulness meditation with cognitive behavioral therapy, has been used as a therapeutic option in patients with tinnitus and IBS. Therefore, its applicability and efficacy were investigated in an IBD population that received conventional therapy [164]. This study revealed that multi-convergent therapy improved quality of life mainly in IBD patients suffering from IBS-like symptoms [164], suggesting that this strategy has beneficial effects only in a subgroup of IBD patients. Although IBS and IBD are medically distinct from each other, symptoms compatible with IBS indeed often co-exist in patients with IBD [165], and should therefore not be underestimated. Within this context, it was recently shown that 36% and 37% of CD and UC patients, respectively, met IBS diagnostic criteria [165], confirming that the presence of IBS-like symptoms in IBD is common [148]. Furthermore, patients with IBS in quiescent IBD were shown to have significantly more anxiety and depression than patients without IBS [165].

More recent data suggested that short-term cognitive behavioral therapy improved quality of life and depression scores in patients with IBD, while not affecting disease activity or other measures of psychological well-being [166]. Others particularly investigated the impact of mind–body therapy, a combination of moderate exercise, diet, stress management training, behavioral techniques and self-care strategies on patients with ulcerative colitis. Results suggested that this approach has a positive effect on IBD development by improving quality of life and mental/physical health scores [167].

As reviewed in detail elsewhere, other complementary and alternative medicines, such as herbal medicine, vitamin supplementation, and exercise have also gained attention for its anti-inflammatory properties and usefulness in the treatment of IBD [148, 168]. Within this context, preclinical data from mice suggested that cannabinoid receptor activation mediates protective mechanisms in experimental colitis [169, 170]. In line with these data, two clinical studies reported that cannabis was able to reduce IBD symptoms [171, 172], pointing towards its ability to treat IBD. Nevertheless, whether cannabis is able to positively affect the course of disease requires further investigation. Other preclinical studies in mice showed an important role for vitamin D and its receptor in the regulation of inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract [173]. Indeed, IBD patients often lack this vitamin [47], and hence, studies investigated the role of vitamin D [174 – 176] in treatment of IBD patients. Although these studies pointed towards beneficial effects on disease activity and risk of relapse, other clinical studies on the use of vitamin B [177] or K [178] in IBD treatment were inconsistent. These data imply that there is a lack of evidence to support positive effects of vitamins on IBD disease course [148]. Likewise, whereas preclinical [60] and clinical studies [179, 180] suggested that low-to-moderate intensity exercise exerted beneficial effects on intestinal inflammation, overall health, and quality of life of IBD patients, further studies investigating the impact of exercise on disease activity and/or prevention of IBD are warranted [148].

Given that stress orchestrates an important influence on structural and functional aspects of the microbiome, multiple studies have also investigated the role of psychobiotics in stress-related diseases. Psychobiotics refer to probiotics or prebiotics that can manipulate commensal gut microbiota, and when ingested at adequate quantities, may indirectly have positive psychiatric effects in psychopathology [181]. As extensively reviewed, both in experimental colitis and human IBD, pre- and probiotics have shown beneficial effects in the prevention of IBD by modulating the trophic functions of the microbiota, improving the intestinal mucosal barrier and mediating anti-inflammatory responses [182]. Given that the intake of psychobiotics also seem to exert antidepressant effects, including improvements in mood and decreases in stress-related plasma and urinary free cortisol [181].
