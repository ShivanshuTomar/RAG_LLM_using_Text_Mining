# 2.2. High Dietary Salt and Gut Microbial Composition

Inflammatory cells such as DC, iMac, neurotrophil, Th1, Th2, CD8, and Th17 cells help to promote the differentiation and function of immunosuppressive cells such as tDC, Treg, MDSC, Breg, tMac, and Tr1 [21]. A reduction in these metabolites may, therefore, have a detrimental effect on the gut’s immune environment. For instance, it is notable that certain pathological conditions, particularly those of an inflammatory disorder, frequently exhibit compromised immune functions, which are often linked to changes in the composition of the gut microbiota and metabolites [22].

In conclusion, microorganisms and their products within the body are important for maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis. Changes in microbial richness and diversity can lead to an imbalance of the gut immune system and be associated with the pathological processes of a number of diseases. This illustrates that certain environmental factors capable of causing microbial alterations may indirectly or directly influence the pathological processes of diseases, thereby giving us potential means for prevention or treatment.

The structure and activity of the trillions of microorganisms that reside in the human gut are influenced by both long-term and short-term dietary intake [23]. The direct long-term effects of dietary intake on host physiology can be either beneficial or detrimental, contingent on the specific dietary regimen [24]. High dietary salt intake can lead to a reduction in beneficial intestinal microbiota, which can inhibit the inflammation response. A reduction in the number of bacteria that are beneficial for gut health, such as Lactobacilli [25], has been observed. This reduction has been shown to down-regulate some anti-inflammatory responses and disrupt immune homeostasis in the gut. Furthermore, an increase in certain harmful bacteria has been shown to exacerbate the inflammatory response, thereby promoting intestinal inflammation. This is particularly evident in the case of bacteria that are detrimental to intestinal health, such as some members of Bacteroides [17].

The majority of studies looking at the influence of elevated salt consumption on the gut flora have employed mouse models. A study of microbial community composition indicated that a high salt consumption could enhance the richness of the small intestinal microbiota while diminishing its diversity. Furthermore, a diet with a high salt intake could exacerbate imbalances in the small intestinal microbiota composition, which could ultimately result in an unhealthy state [26]. More particularly, a diet high in salt has been demonstrated to alter the profile of the gut microbiota, resulting in a rapid depletion of Lactobacillus spp. in both mice and humans [15]. Lactobacillus spp., which belongs to Firmicutes at the phylum level, has been demonstrated to possess the capacity to both prevent and reduce the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease and other inflammatory diseases by modulating the JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways [25, 27]. It can be reasonably inferred that a diet high in salt intake will result in a reduction in the abundance of intestinal Lactobacilli spp. Such a reduction will, consequently, give rise to an attenuation in the anti-inflammatory response, which may, in turn, contribute to the development of inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, Yan X. et al. demonstrated that a diet with a high salt content led to a notable reduction in beneficial Bacteroidetes such as Bacteroidetes fragilis, which changed the metabolic profiles and eventually led to a high blood pressure [28] (Figure 1).

In contrast, a high salt intake has also been linked to an increased level of certain microbial species. In a more detailed classification, Wang C et al. found that the abundances of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae are greater and that there is a higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) in mice fed with a high-salt diet than in those fed with a low-salt diet [29]. Members of Ruminococcus have been identified as the primary mucolytic bacterium in patients with Crohn’s disease [30]. Their metabolites have the potential to disrupt the mucus layer, thereby facilitating bacterial translocation and establishing a link with IBD [31]. Furthermore, the F/B ratio is one of the biomarkers used to assess gut.
