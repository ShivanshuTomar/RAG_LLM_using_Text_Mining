# NEURO-IMMUNE INTERACTIONS: HOW THE NERVOUS AND IMMUNE SYSTEMS INFLUENCE EACH OTHER

# Depressive symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease

Recognition and diagnosis facilitating earlier intervention with more potent biological agents [3,4]. Among these, the anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents transformed the paradigm of care for appropriate patients after their introduction more than a decade ago [83,84]. Although anti-TNF agents can neutralize soluble TNF, in IBD their probable mechanism of action is through binding membrane-bound TNF [85] and inducing apoptosis in proinflammatory T lymphocytes, thereby decreasing levels of T cell-derived proinflammatory cytokines and reduction in active inflammatory cells in the intestinal tissue [85].

Anti-TNF agents demonstrated initial promise as a novel treatment for depressive symptoms in the general population. In a placebo-controlled trial of 60 patients, inhibition of TNF did not improve depressive symptoms after 12 weeks. However, in a subset (n = 21) with high baseline CRP, the remission rate was greater in the intervention group [86]. Conversely, in a network meta-analysis in people with rheumatoid arthritis, anti-TNF therapy showed weaker effects on depressive symptoms compared to other biologicals such as anti-IL-6 [87]. In a retrospective study of 69 patients with IBD, anti-TNF therapy was associated with significant reduction in PHQ-9 depression scores regardless of IBD disease response, and changes in PHQ-9 were strongly correlated with changes in CRP [15]. In a prospective observational study in IBD, patients starting anti-TNF (n = 49) improved in overall depressive symptoms and sleep over 14 weeks, although data were missing for the majority at follow-up [88]. By contrast, a meta-analysis of 23 RCTs found that fatigue was significantly increased with anti-TNF-α therapy in people with IBD [89]. Suggesting that fatigue in particular may be mediated through other pathways.

Vedolizumab is a newer biological agent specific for the integrin αβ7, which acts by blocking the trafficking of activating lymphocytes to the gut. In this way, it is an effective and specific treatment for IBD and provides an important test of the gut–brain axis in depressive symptoms by blocking the gut specifically. Vedolizumab is generally regarded as a safe and effective intervention [90], and in one observational study, patients starting vedolizumab (n = 111) experienced a reduction in depressive symptoms and sleep over time [88]. Replication of these findings in parallel with changes in inflammation is awaited.

Anti-depressants are a first-line treatment for moderate or severe depression, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are most commonly used due to their efficacy and favourable side-effect profile [5]. Notably, SSRIs have some effects in reducing inflammation [91], while tricyclics may have even greater anti-inflammatory effects [92]. To date, however, only one RCT in IBD has tested an anti-depressant for depressive symptoms in people with IBD [93], and measures of inflammation were not analysed.

# Summary: theoretical framework

Fig. 1 outlines a conceptually attractive model by which inflammation may link depressive symptoms and IBD. The evidence suggests that depressive symptoms, fatigue or sleep problems provide a biomarker for an aggressive form of IBD that is underpinned by an unfavourable microbiome, which leads to over-active immune pathways. Vulnerability may be conferred by female sex, early life stress and lifestyle behaviours. In turn, psychological distress leads to further dysfunction of the axis and increased intestinal permeability.

At the same time, this inflammation model presents several opportunities for intervention. First, psychological therapies can help to reduce levels of IBD distress, thereby reducing effects on the HPA axis and inflammation. Anti-depressant therapies can help to reduce inflammation and may restore HPA axis function. Systemic anti-inflammatory treatments, such as biological cytokine antagonists, can help to reduce the effects of inflammation on the brain. Finally, interventions to alter the gut microbiota and gut-specific anti-inflammatory treatments can reduce upstream effects of the gut on driving the gut–brain axis and inflammation. For such interventions, greater benefit is likely the earlier it targets the natural course of the disease pathway. For example, blocking the causes of inflammation is likely to produce more sustained benefits than simply limiting its effects, while treatments to address underlying vulnerability to the effects of inflammation – such as reducing early life stressors, poor diet and smoking – may have the greatest potential for prevention.

# Future directions

In epidemiology, prospective observational studies are needed that combine detailed profiling of inflammation (including cytokines, high-sensitivity CRP and markers of T cell immunity), measures of depressive symptoms (including clinical depression, self-report depressive symptoms and detailed measures of somatic symptoms) and their associations with IBD outcomes. Such research would be illuminated by mechanistic studies testing the interactions between stress and gut microbiome with inflammation in the depressive symptoms of IBD.

Despite several studies of psychological therapy in paediatric and adult IBD [18,94], there has been no RCT of anti-depressant pharmacotherapy in people with IBD.
