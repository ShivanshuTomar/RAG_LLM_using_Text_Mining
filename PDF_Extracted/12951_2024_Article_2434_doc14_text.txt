# In vivo toxicity test.

Healthy mice were orally administered with 10 mg kg−1 YBNs, 5 mg kg−1 YBNs@PDA, 10 mg kg−1 YBNs@PDA or PBS for 7 days. Body weight changes were monitored during treatment. Mice serum was collected for biochemistry assessment with several blood parameters: ALT, AST, CRE and BUN. Histological changes of major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and colon) were analysed through H&E staining.

# Statistical analysis.

All measurements were taken with separate samples rather than with repeated measurements. For data analysis, GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software; San Diego, CA) was utilized. Unless otherwise specified, statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed student’s t-test, and results are presented as means ± standard deviations. Statistics were considered to be significant when the P value was less than 0.05.
