# Exosomal nucleic acids

RNAs are relevant in inflammatory processes, including their established involvement in the modulation of the intestinal immune system, barrier functions and microbiota, as well as having a role in the pathogenesis of IBD.

# (a) Immune cell modulation

IECs form a single-layered lining to the intestines, linked to neighbouring cells through tight junctions and anchored to the extracellular matrix. They may use cargos of exosomes to communicate molecular or genetic information to distant cells or to the gut microbiome. Exosomal secretion from IECs occurs at the basolateral and apical sides. Whereas basolateral exosome secretion elicits local immune responses by presenting luminal antigens to lymphocytes, apical secretion enhances the secretion of anti-microbial peptides (Smythies & Smythies, 2014). Hu et al. (2013) reported that luminal secretion of IEC exosomes occurs after pathogenic infection has downregulated the miRNA let-7, leading to increased delivery of anti-microbial peptides to inhibit the pathogen. This reveals the presence of a miRNA-associated regulatory loop between IECs and pathogens (Hu et al., 2013). Furthermore, basolateral release of IEC exosomes activates DCs to present exogenous peptides (via MHC class II) to T-cells, although little is known about miRNA involvement in this mechanism (Mallegol et al., 2007). The role of lncRNAs in IBD has been documented in many studies. These RNAs are enriched in exosomes with their expression levels in exosomes dependent on the cell of origin (Dragomir, Chen, & Calin, 2018). Liu et al. (2018a) report that inhibition of the lncRNA NEAT1 (nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1) suppresses the inflammatory response in IBD via regulating exosome-mediated polarization of macrophages and the intestinal epithelial barrier. miR-21 (enriched in exosomes) has been implicated in different phases of IBD pathogenesis. The deletion of miR-21 attenuated the symptoms associated with a T-cell transfer colitis model, and a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis model (Wu et al., 2014). On the other hand, levels of miR-21 were reduced in T cells obtained from colonic mucosa during the recovery stage of UC (Ando et al., 2016). These data suggest that miR-21 both appears to execute its versatile functions in a colitis-dependent manner, and also seems involved in the modulation of T-cell functions to regulate IBD.

Another nucleic acid highly enriched in exosomes including MSC-derived exosomes is miR-223 (Wang et al., 2015b). Existing data on the role of miR-223 in IBD is seemingly contradictory. On the one hand, miR-223 suppresses gene expression of claudin-8, leading to activation of the IL-23 pathway, which is critical for IBD progression (Wang et al., 2016a). On the other hand, however, mice deficient in miR-223 were found to be more susceptible to induced colitis, suggesting a modulatory role of miR-223 in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. These mice exhibited reduced levels of intestinal CX3CR1 (hi) macrophages, accompanied by high levels of expression of a pro-inflammatory phenotype in intestinal DCs and macrophages (Zhou et al., 2015). Moreover, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs transfected with mimics of miR148b-5p showed increased expression of miR148b-5p in MSCs, leading to downregulation of the expression of 15-lox-1 in macrophages to promote colonic tissue repair in IBD (Kang et al., 2019).

# (b) Gut-microbiome modulation

The gut microbiome can be altered by dietary interventions to treat and prevent several diseases (Sonnenburg et al., 2016). In an experiment investigating mechanisms by which food substances modulate mucosal commensals, Teng et al. (2018) demonstrate that plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (ELNs) containing certain RNAs are taken up by the gut microbiome resulting in altered microbiome composition as well as host physiology. They further report that ginger-derived ELNs (containing microRNA mdo-miR7267-3p) are preferentially taken up by Lactobacillaceae leading to targeting of several genes in Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The complex gene targeting mechanism yields increased expression of indole-3-carboxaldehyde (I3A), which subsequently induces IL-22 production. This outcome is associated with intestinal barrier function improvement as well as amelioration of colitis in mice through an IL-22-dependent mechanism (Teng et al., 2018). Gut epithelial cells and homeodomain only protein X-positive (Hopx+) cells are the main sources of faecal circulating miRNA. These miRNAs have been shown to enter gut-bacteria like Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium nucleatum to control their gene transcription and growth. Transplanting these miRNAs restored faecal microbiota composition and also ameliorated induced colitis (Liu et al., 2016). Figure 4 summarizes exosomal effects on the gut microbiome and intestinal barrier functions.

# (c) Intestinal barrier modulation

The general significance of miRNAs in IECs has been investigated. Dicer knockout in IECs of mice led to decreased goblet cell numbers, increased cryptic apoptosis, and inhibited intestinal barrier function, implying an important role of IEC miRNAs in supporting epithelial constitution and protection (McKenna et al., 2010). Functionally, IEC miRNAs contribute to the morphology and function of M cells, a crucial component of the mucosal antigen-sampling system (Nakato et al., 2016). Chen et al. (2016) detected six miRNAs that were significantly upregulated in IPEC-J2 cells alongside other molecules like proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), after treatment with milk-derived exosomes. This upregulation coupled with inhibited expression of the p53 gene, promoted intestinal cell proliferation as well as intestinal tract development (Chen et al., 2016). Inhibition of the lncRNA NEAT1 suppresses the inflammatory response in IBD via modulation of the.
