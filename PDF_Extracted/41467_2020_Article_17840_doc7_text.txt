microbiota48. In line with this, we found that 18.8% of the menaquinone biosynthesis pathway in IBD patients was attributed to E. coli, which is two times higher than in the two population-based cohorts (Wilcoxon test P &lt; 3.0×10−11). Another notable IBD key pathway is the tetrahydrofolate pathway, which is responsible for folic acid derivative biosynthesis and supplementation of folic acid. This pathway has been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in IBD patients60. Interestingly, previous research has shown that oral intake of L-glutamine attenuates the colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium in mice61.

We identified a negative co-abundance with L-glutamine biosynthesis and biosynthesis of other amino acids like L-isoleucine and L-methionine. Previous research showed that both these amino acids play an important role in the immune system62,63. L-glutamine has been tested as a supplement in patients with IBD but did not show improvements in clinical outcomes like disease activity scores64. Our results show large numbers of connections for L-glutamine with other pathways such as the biosynthesis of other amino acids. These pathways might also be of interest when exploring L-glutamine as an intervention for IBD.

In obesity, we identified the allantoin degradation pathway as a key pathway, showing obesity-specific co-abundance relationships to 85 pathways, mainly negative correlations with biosynthesis of oxaloacetate/aspartate amino acids. These pathways are related to insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. However, their co-abundance relationships did not show significant differences between patients and non-diabetic individuals, which is likely due to a power issue as there were only 35 diabetic patients in 300OB.

Instead, we found three species co-abundances related to the presence of atheriosclerotic plaque, involving D. longicatena, D. micigenerans, L. bacterium 9.1.43BFAA and C. comes. Notably, D. Longticatena and Lachnospiraceae species have been linked to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease9.

Altogether, our analyses show that microbial dysbiosis in disease may not be driven solely by differences in abundance level; it may also reflect shifts in microbial interactions that are mirrored in co-abundance analyses. Particularly when applied to metagenomics sequence data, pathway-based co-abundance networks provide further insights into functional dysbiosis in IBD and obesity.

However, we also acknowledge several limitations of our study. This is an in silico network analysis based on correlation in bacterial abundance levels. Even with the large sample size, our study is still undersized for making comparisons to the number of interactions assessed. In recent years, many different network tools have been developed to tackle the statistical challenges in inferring networks for compositional data. In this study, we applied two independent methods, SparCC and SpiecEasi, to establish microbial co-abundance networks based on MetaPhlan and HUMAnN2 annotation. Our analysis can thus be biased due to these annotation tools. Other annotation tools, e.g. mcSEED65, may yield different pictures of microbial community and functional profile, thereby identifying different co-abundance networks. Thus such in silico-based network inferences require further functional validation.

Metagenomic data generation and pre-processing. All participants from the four cohorts were asked to collect faecal samples at home and to place them in their home freezer (−20 °C) within 15 min after production. Subsequently, a nurse visited the participant to pick up the faecal samples on dry ice and transfer them to the laboratory. Aliquots were then made and stored at −80 °C until further processing. The same protocol for faecal DNA isolation and metagenomics sequencing was used for all four cohorts. Faecal DNA isolation was performed using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, cat. 80204). After DNA extraction, faecal DNA was sent to the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT in Cambridge, MA, USA, where library preparation and whole-genome shotgun sequencing were performed on the Illumina HiSeq platform. From the raw metagenomic sequencing data, low-quality reads were discarded by the sequencing facility and reads belonging to the human genome were removed by mapping the data to the human reference genome (version NCBI37) with Bowtie2 (v2.1.0)75.

The relative abundance of gut microbial taxonomic units was determined using MetaPhlan (v2.7.2)76, and the relative abundances of metabolic pathways were determined using the HUMAnN2 pipeline (v0.10.0)77, which maps DNA/RNA.
