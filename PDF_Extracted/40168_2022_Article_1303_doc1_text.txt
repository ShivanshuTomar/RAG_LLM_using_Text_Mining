# Background

The gut harbours a diverse community of microbiota that exhibit large between-individual variations [1], which next-generation sequencing has linked to host phenotypes [2]. Millions of years of coevolution between host and microbiota have led to a mutualistic relationship in which microbiota likely mediate host physiological suitability [3]. Specifically, host physiology can be altered by microbiota-induced cell signalling and proliferation, leading to changes in the mucosa, barrier function and immune response and thereby affecting phenotype [4–6]. Given the broad range of effects of microbiota on host physiology and the induction and function of the immune system, it is unsurprising that the combination of host and microbiota largely drives the development of disease resistance phenotypes. The immune response to disease is an essential indicator of the host’s disease resistance phenotype, which differs depending on microbiota composition. Host-microbiota interactions have been implicated in various gut-related diseases, including diarrhoea, enterotoxaemia and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [7–10]. These diseases are characterised by microbial dysbiosis and perturbations of host homeostasis, but the roles of changes in the microbiota in different disease resistance phenotypes have not been entirely determined. Moreover, whether and to what extent the gut microbiota drives diseases or is altered in response to disease remains unclear. Intervention studies targeting different disease resistance phenotypes are required to address this gap. Given the importance and complexity of microbiota across different pig breeds, there is increasing interest in identifying the composition of the microbiota and their functional contribution to achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of disease resistance phenotype formation.

The Yorkshire pig is a common commercial pig breed worldwide and is found in most countries with pig breeding industries. Pedigreed pigs of this breed are adaptable to various environments and display a certain resistance to diseases [11], and the difference in the disease resistance phenotype compared with native breeds may not be small [12]. Min pigs are a native Chinese breed with stronger disease resistance than Yorkshire pigs. Previous studies have demonstrated that compared with other breeds, Min pigs reach the peak of diarrhoea later in the weaning period and have a lower diarrhoeal burden [13]. The more excellent disease resistance of Min pigs compared with other breeds, such as Yorkshire pigs, might offer a route to characterise efficient microbiomes. Recently, we found that Min pig faecal microbiota transfer could modulate the intestinal microbiota and increase immunoglobulins and antimicrobial peptides in Yorkshire piglets [14], suggesting that the microbiota of Min pigs can enhance the health of Yorkshire pigs by affecting host physiology. This may also partially explain why the disease resistance of Min pigs is stronger than that of Yorkshire pigs. While we have identified an association of the microbiota with diseases, how certain core bacteria in Min pigs contribute to shaping the disease resistance phenotype compared with Yorkshire pigs under the same nutrition and management remains unclear. We hypothesised that Yorkshire pigs might lack important host-microbiota interactions, resulting in weak host adaptability under pressure from diseases and inflammatory immune stimuli. DSS-induced colitis is a well-established model of acute colitis with ulceration resembling ulcerative colitis in humans [15, 16]. Ulcerative colitis, a type of IBD, can be viewed as an autoimmune disease strongly influenced by disruptions in host-microbiota homoeostasis [17]. Therefore, in this study, we employed the DSS-induced colitis model to identify certain commensal bacteria and their metabolites in Min pigs and Yorkshire pigs that may affect host physiological suitability and subsequently affect IBD susceptibility. The current study provides fundamental information about the potential links between gut microbiota and host phenotypes and may contribute to screening for core intestinal microbial candidates associated with host health.

# Methods

# Animals and experimental design

All animal procedures were performed in compliance with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Northeast Agricultural University (certification number NEAU-[2011]-9). Sixteen Min pigs (50 days old) and sixteen Yorkshire pigs (50 days old) in the same physiological state were selected from a commercial farm and individually housed in stainless steel metabolism crates with automatic troughs and drinking water nipples for free access to water. Animals received the same diet. After 10 days of acclimation, the pigs of each breed were randomised into 2 treatments administered via gavage for 5 days: CON (control, sterile saline) and DSS (4% DSS in 100 mL of water). The first dose of DSS water had a volume of 200 mL and was preceded by a 12-h fasting period. The dose of DSS was chosen by referring to Bassaganya et al. [18]. All pigs were slaughtered at 66 days of age. Samples were collected from each pig immediately after slaughter. Colon tissue was rinsed and stored immediately at −80 °C until further analysis. Colon contents were collected and stored at −80 °C until microbiota and metabolite analyses.
