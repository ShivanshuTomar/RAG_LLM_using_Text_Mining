|Bias Type|Risk|Quote/Comment|
|---|---|---|
|Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)|High risk|Quote: "The study was designed as an open-label, randomized, parallel-group comparison study." (page 11) Comment: study was open-label, so it likely did not have blinding of participants and personnel.|
|Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)|Low risk|Quote: published protocol stated, "Blind method for clinical efficacy evaluator and analysts."|
|Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)|Low risk|Quote: "An intention-to-treat analysis was performed." (page 12) Comment: appeared that all 20 participants (10 in each group) were included in the analysis.|
|Selective reporting (reporting bias)|Low risk|Comment: a protocol was available for review of methods and a priori outcomes; all intended outcomes were reported in the paper. Trial was registered at www.chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR2000030080).|
|Other bias|Low risk|Comment: no other risk of bias noted.|
