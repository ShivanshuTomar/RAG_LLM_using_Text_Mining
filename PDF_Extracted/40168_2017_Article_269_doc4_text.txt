# Clinical response of CDI to FMT is independent of engraftment or donor type but underlying IBD influences changes in gut microbial ecology after FMT

In order to determine if the response of CDI to FMT was dependent on donor stool engraftment, we determined Spearman’s correlation coefficient between fecal microbial communities prior to 7 and 28 days post-transplant. The fecal microbial communities from patients with CDI were distinct from donor communities prior to transplant (Spearman’s r &lt; 0.2 for all subjects, Fig. 1c). Following transplant, communities showed an increase in correlation to donor stool at day 7 (Spearman’s r &gt; 0.4 for 85% of the subjects, Fig. 1c) and a spread for all subjects at day 28 ranging from below 0.2 up to 0.6 (Fig. 1c). Using Source-Tracker [23], we found that after FMT, subjects with IBD retained a higher proportion of their original communities (Mann-Whitney p &lt; 0.05 at day 7, and p = 0.06 at day 28; Fig. 2a, b) and a significantly lower proportion of new communities (Mann-Whitney p &lt; 0.05 at days 7 and 28), as compared to the patients without IBD. The expansion of new taxa following FMT as seen in patients without IBD may represent a beneficial ecological change following FMT; however, future studies will be needed to address the biological effect of newly acquired community members following FMT. Consequently, in patients with IBD, we observed a smaller group of taxa that change significantly 7 days after FMT. In both groups, Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium showed a significant increase in relative abundance, with Blautia, only being increased for patients without IBD. Additionally, these patients showed a decrease in relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Veillonella, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Erwina, Proteus, Salmonella, and Trabulsiella (Fig. 2c, d, ANCOM p &lt; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni-Holm’s method [18]).

All patients had either clinical or microbiological remission (negative C. difficile testing in the presence of ongoing diarrhea) confirming that initial response of CDI to FMT is not dependent on the degree of donor stool engraftment. In this small cohort of patients, those with underlying IBD had higher number of late relapses of CDI. We found no significant differences in gut microbiota composition following FMT from standard donors or related donors (Mann-Whitney p &gt; 0.05 at days 7 and 28), suggesting that engraftment of donor stool was independent of donor type. Furthermore, as all patients had ongoing clinical remission with microbiological response (if measured), donor type does not appear to affect CDI-related clinical response.

# Change in bacterial diversity after FMT is dependent on underlying IBD

IBD disease course, as measured by the need for specific IBD therapies, did not change after FMT, and patients with CDI and underlying IBD retained a higher proportion of the pre-transplant communities and lower proportion of new communities following FMT. Thus, underlying IBD appears to affect the change in gut microbial ecology resulting in a less significant increase in overall diversity. In subjects without IBD, Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (which measures the total branch length of a phylogenetic tree that a given sample covers [26]) reached a level comparable to healthy donors (Mann-Whitney’s U p &lt; 0.001, Fig. 2e). The differences in phylogenetic diversity following FMT between subjects with and without IBD became evident on day 7 and persisted on day 28 (Mann-Whitney, day 1 p = 0.163, day 7 p = 0.0058, and day 27 p = 0.008, Fig. 2e). A linear regression of phylogenetic diversity versus MD index (Additional file 4: Figure S3) shows a significantly lower negative correlation between the increase in phylogenetic diversity and the increase of the MD index in patients with IBD (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, IBD R = −0.68, no IBD R = −0.83; p &lt; 0.0001; Additional file 4: Figure S3) suggesting a lack of recovery of phylogenetic diversity in patients with IBD as the MD index improves.

# Discussion

In this study, we found that gut microbiota diversity changes rapidly following FMT for treatment of CDI and resembles donor microbiota diversity, similar to previous studies. A successful response of CDI to FMT was seen with a diverse group of donors and at levels of engraftment (as measured by correlation to donor stool) varying from 50 to 94% (at day 7) and 34–93% (at day 28) based on the proportion of communities attributed to the donor following FMT per SourceTracker, suggesting these are not critical factors in determining response. Similarly, a recent study that evaluated pre- and post-FMT (for recurrent CDI) gut microbiome samples from a subset of patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial [27], compared donor FMT to autologous FMT suggested that complete engraftment of donor bacteria may be not necessary, if functionally, critical taxa are present in subjects following initial antibiotic therapy for CDI [28]. This study excluded patients with IBD but was able to compare autologous to donor FMT unlike our study. There was a higher number of recurrent CDI following.
