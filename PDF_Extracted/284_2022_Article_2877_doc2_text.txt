# Gut Dysbiosis: Commensals Replacing the Pathogens in COVID‑19

of microbes including pathogens can cause systemic infection and organ dysfunction. The interconnection of lung-gut axis is particularly important in context with COVID-19 disease severity [2, 10].

Many studies on dysbiosis due to COVID-19, have been hampered because of the ongoing pandemic. Most of the efforts have been made for the urgent development of therapeutics, vaccines, convalescent and monoclonal sera. However, based on some important findings, we highlighted the possible implications of microbes, viruses, secretary molecules and gut on the immune response in context with IBD and COVID-19 severity.

The common symptoms of SARSCoV-2 infection are fever, cough, fatigue, headache, diarrhoeas etc., where abdominal pain is referred to the GI symptoms. A developed state of interstitial pneumonia with high viral loads, and activated macrophages, monocytes producing pro-inflammatory cytokines could result into ARDS along with the complications of GI, neurological, thrombotic, thromboembolic diseases and multiorgan failure [11–13]. The disease severity in COVID-19 is reported higher in terms of morbidity and mortality [14], which principally explains the virulent nature of the virus evading the host’s immune system and even becoming more transmissible by producing relevant mutations in spike (S) protein/ or receptor binding domain (RBD) [6, 11, 12, 15, 16]. A range of emergency drugs, vaccines and antibodies are being used at present to control the infection [6, 17].

During the past decades, the microbiome research has been given more attention, especially in regard to its relevance in maintaining the physiological balance. Human GIT contains up to 2000 bacterial species, and classified in 12 different phyla such as Protobacteria (Escherichia), Firmicutes (Lactobacilllus, Bacillus, and Clostridium), Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium), and Bacteroides (Bacteroides) [18, 19]. In addition, the gut microbiome constitutes appx. 3 million genes are 150 times more than the human genome [10]. The relevance of GM realized, when the 50% hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Italy were detected with viral RNA in their stool and the GM profile signatured with depletion in commensals such as, Bacteroidaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae, substituted by Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Serratia, and Collinsella along with Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Actinomycetes etc. ICU patients were also reported to develop enterococcal septicemia [20].

The ruptured mucosa of intestine shifts gut microbes and other molecules e.g., endotoxins, cell components, metabolites etc., along the gut-lung axis, instigating the immune dysfunction and secondary bacterial and fungal infections causing systemic hyperinflammation in hospitalized patients [6, 20–22]. SARSCoV-2 infection in enterocytes persists longer, even after the clearance of virus from respiratory tract manifesting the clinical severity with GI disorders [23–27]. Gut dysbiosis took place at the time of hospitalization presented with IBD in some patients. A significant increase in the opportunistic pathogens like Streptococcus spp., Rothia spp., Veillonella spp. and Actinomyces spp.; were also reported in COVID-19 patients [23, 26].

Over the course of hospitalization, the depletion of Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides massiliensis, and Bacteroides ovatus, were found to be replaced with Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramosum, Clostridium hathewayi; establishing a direct correlation with fecal viral loads & occurring COVID-19 severity events [20, 23, 25, 28]. Moreover, the higher transcriptional activities from 3ʹ-5ʹ ends of SARSCoV-2 were correlated with the presence of Collinsella, Streptococcus and Morganella sps. Parabacteroides, Bacteroides, Alistipes and Lachnospiraceae, the SCFAs producing bacteria, were found depleted [26, 29]. The fecal samples with higher infectivity are related to the active functional metabolic pathways of nucleotide, amino-acid biosynthesis and glycolysis. Essentially, the building blocks and macromolecules formation is significant for bacterial multiplications. However, the exact relationship among them is yet to be revealed. The 15 taxa out of 23 taxa of fecal microbiome, were related to the phylum of Firmicutes-Coprobacillus spp., Clostridium ramosum, and C. hathewayi [3, 23, 25, 28]. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18 was correlated with relative abundance of Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Citrobacter, which alter the gut microbiota stimulating the intestinal cytokine formation and subsequently form the ‘cytokine storm’ [30]. Some studies authenticate the commensals substituting the pathogens in COVID-19 with in GI and respiratory tract, are presented in Table 1.

Rothia, Veillonella, and Actnomycetes were positively correlated with C-reactive protein, an indication of bacterial infection. Fecal mycobiota enriched with Candida and Aspergillus prolonged the dysbiosis persisted ~ 12 days (Table 1, [3]. In addition, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides dorei, B. massiliensis, B. ovatus and B. thetaiotaomicron, were inversely correlated to the viral load & downregulating the ACE-2 expression in the intestine of mice [25, 28, 32].

The antiviral effects of Lactobacillus planatarum has been studied, in animal model, to control the SARSCoV-2 infection. Previously, L. plantarum experimented on porcine enterocytes cells (IPEC-J2) to control the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and gastroenteritis virus [31, 35]. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is also reported to regulate the intestinal permeability, spleen-colon homeostasis, inflammatory.
