# 2. Search Strategy

For this narrative review, we selected peer-reviewed preclinical and clinical articles as well as meta-analyses and important reviews from the PubMed database between January 1980 and June 2019. The following search terms were used: inflammatory bowel disease/IBD, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, gut/intestines, microbiota/microbiome, brain, interplay/axis, psychological/chronic/acute/cognitive stress, lifestyle factors, stress management, stress resilience, inflammation, disease activity, therapies/interventions/therapeutic strategies.

# 3. Gut/Microbiota/Brain Interplay

In this section, we will focus on the tight association between the brain and gut, discussing the involvement of endocrine, immune, and neural pathways as well as the gut microbiota.

# 3.1. Brain/Gut Interaction

The hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is an endocrine pathway belonging to the limbic system of the brain. In response to stress [4], the activated HPA axis causes the secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus, which stimulates the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In turn, ACTH triggers the immunosuppressive stress-hormone cortisol from the adrenal cortex [5], which ordinarily induces the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines. However, in response to stress, sustained cortisol activity has also been associated with pro-inflammatory responses [6]. Likewise, stress-induced cortisol was shown to increase intestinal barrier dysfunction, as recently shown by crypt analyses from rodents and humans [7]. Moreover, administration of cortisol in a porcine model caused a shift in microbiota composition, [8], pointing towards a role for cortisol in regulating intestinal inflammation and altering microbiota composition.

In addition to the HPA axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) coordinates the function of the gastrointestinal tract. The ANS is known to trigger efferent signals from the central nervous system (CNS; i.e., brain and spinal cord) to the intestinal wall to regulate mucosal immune responses [9] and other intestinal functions, such as nutrient absorption [10]. Vice versa, via enteric, spinal, and vagal nerves, afferent signals from the intestinal lumen are also known to regulate behavior, sleep, and stress reactivity [11, 12]. Upon receiving stimuli from the diet and gut microbiota [13, 14], the enteric nervous system (ENS, “second brain”), which is part of the peripheral nervous system, mainly communicates with the CNS in a bidirectional manner. However, the ENS is also capable of intrinsically innervating the gut [15] in an autonomous manner [16].

# 3.2. Gut Microbiota

The gastrointestinal tract serves as a dynamic and local ecosystem for gut microbiota. Whereas, often being classified into two major phyla, i.e., Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes [17], the gut microbiota is composed of over 35,000 bacterial species [18]. Besides playing a role in metabolism [19], it is also essential for controlling processes related to barrier function against pathogenic microorganism colonization, such as mucosal integrity [20], immunomodulation [21], and pathogen protection [22]. Recently, preclinical [23], translational [24], and clinical [25] studies suggested that alterations in the structural composition or function of the microbiome can contribute to the development of mental illness, including depression-like behavior, and thus, is a vital component linking the gut/brain axis. In line, data have indicated strong correlations between alterations in gut microbiota and the development of multifactorial chronic inflammatory disorders, such as IBD [26, 27], suggesting that dysbiosis is an important factor in both gastrointestinal and mental health.

Intestinal bacteria and their metabolites are also involved in gut-associated neuroimmune mechanisms that influence mood and behavior leading to depression. These mechanisms include tryptophan metabolism as well as neural signaling within the ENS [28]. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid, derived from the diet.
