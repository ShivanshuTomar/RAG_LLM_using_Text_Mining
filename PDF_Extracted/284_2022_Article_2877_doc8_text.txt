# Adaptive Immune Response and Microbiota

CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells production is negatively correlated with IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- α induction. However, T-cells function eventually gets fully restored after recovery reducing the cytokine and chemokine production. Gut microbiota is the key regulator of CD8 + cell function, by producing SCFAs, butyrate and propionate directly to modulate the CD8 + and Tc17 cells. IFNγ and granzyme B expression promote Tc17 cell towards cytotoxic function in COVID-19 infection [2]. Notably, antiviral immunity involves the TLR4 against the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the gram-negative microflora signaling the pathway through NFkB; and the enteric viruses to protect against the intestinal damage and pathogenic bacteria [48].

B-cells maintain the homeostasis by secreting IgA antibodies, to upregulate the immune function, shaping the microbiota composition. Secretary sIgA antibodies make coat around the colitogenic bacteria inhibiting the perturbation of enteric inflammation. Repression in transcription factor GATA 4 metabolites results in increasing the absorption and metabolic alterations. Mesenchymal cells secrete a cytokine RANKL which help cells to adopt IgA production and gut microbiota diversification. Absence of commensals in mice models, repress the CD4 + cell differentiation. Th17 cells induced by Citrobacter spp. are mostly studied, which is the source of potent cytokines inducing the differentiation of Th17 largely in intestine and skin. CD8 + cytotoxic T-cells (Tc) are also regulated by microbiome, and largely associated with removal of pathogens and cancer cells [63, 64].

The bile converted into secondary bile in colon by microbiota helps regulate the gut RORγ + regulatory T-cell homeostasis. Tfh cells are crucial to help B-cell and also contribute to the germinal cell formation, memory B-cells, affinity maturation and building response in high affinity antibody formation. However, lack of Tfh cells repress the programmed cell death (PD-1) and the ATP-gated P2RX7 receptor can alter the gut microbiota. Tfh cells association with microbiota is reciprocal, as in GF mice lack of Tfh cells can be restored by producing TLR2 receptor agonist by microbiota to activate MyD88 signaling [65, 66].

In Peyer's patches, Tfh cells lower the access to IL-2 to CD4 + T-cells, hence amplifying the Bcl-6 on Tfh cells. But Tfh cells can also boost the autoantibody formation to induce arthritis [67]. DCs are the important class of APCs, which directly send the dendrites to outside epithelium to capture the pathogens. Spleen tyrosin kinase (Syk) signaling pathway is critical for adaptive immune signaling to induce of IL-17 and IL-22 in CD4 + T-cells. NFkB is also a crucial kinase for DC functions, to alter the secretion of IgA with changed microbiota rendering the mice vulnerable to enteric pathogens [68, 69]. GF mice showing less mature phenotype iNKT with exposure to Bacteroide fragilis were able to regain the activity of iNKT cells and protected the animals from oxazolone-induced colitis [70].

# Immune Response Executed by Virome

The human gut virome, an emerging concept, is composed of prokaryotic viruses /or bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses to share the required genomic information with microflora and host cells, which may influence the composition and function of gut microbial community [71]. Constant sharing of genes between bacteriophages and bacteria may help sustain the important functions like, oxidative stress & antibiotic use tolerance. Nayfach et al. [8], reported that > 75% genome composed of DNA phages to infect Bacteroidis and Clostridia classes and suggested a new gut database could help explore the functionality of gut virome and other associated retro elements for diversifying the phage community and bacterial hosts. It is possible to transplant the fecal microbiome (FMT) consists of bacteriophages because patients with C. difficile infection have altered bacteriophage abundance than the normal controls. A successful transplantation appears to be associated with implantation of Caudovirales spp. [72]. In opposite, the eukaryotic viruses such as, norwalk, rotaviruses, enteroviruses and now SARS CoV-2 can cause IBD. [18, 73]. Evidences have shown that virome related immune response is different from individual to individual, contributing to the gut physiology and homeostasis [74, 75].

Enteric cells are the barriers for virus invasion; DCs, macrophages, and lymphoid tissues (GALT/ or Peyer’s patches encounter the viruses. Viral nucleic acids are sensed by the PRRs such as TLRs; and these endosomal receptors signal through MyD88 and TRIF. The cytosolic RIG-1 and MDA5 signal through MAVS to stimulate the expression of IFN I and IFN III (Fig. 3) [76, 77]. Both RIG and MDA5 are essential to produce optimal antiviral immune response against rotavirus and dsRNA that infects small intestine. GI causing viruses e.g., norovirus, the ssRNA sensing occurs through TLR3, TLR7 and MDA5. Cytosolic NLRs also have a role in restricting the viruses [78]. NLRP6, a cofactor, signals through MAVS, deficient mice provide the dysregulated response to IFN I and IFN III, and become susceptible to encephalomyocarditis virus and murine norovirus [55]. Rotavirus sensed by NLRP9b is essential for inflammasome mediated apoptosis/or pyroptosis. Notably, rotavirus signaling associated with this pathway to induce IFN has already explained that the other PRRs are not enough to control the viral infection [29].

IFN I (IFNα and IFNβ) attach through the IFN α /β receptors (IFNAR 1 and 2 complexes), while IFN III (IFN λ) binds to interferon receptor IFNR1 or IL10R2 complex to induce an antiviral gene expression. It is presumed that
