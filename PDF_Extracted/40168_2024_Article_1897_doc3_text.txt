# Intestinal succinate‑consuming bacteria differ in their succinate conversion rate

and Phascolarctobacterium_A were most strongly associated with the fast category, Phascolarctobacterium and Flavonifractor with the intermediate category, and Phascolarctobacterium and Dialister with the slow category. Of the four identified putative succinate consuming taxa, only one was typically dominant in any one specific enrichment. These data imply that these four genera are most likely those that are responsible for succinate consumption in the enrichments.

Representative genomes of each of these four genera all contained the gene cluster for succinate to propionate conversion first described in Veillonella parvula, starting from the succinate-CoA transferase to the methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (Supplementary Figure S1a). The methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase subunit alpha (mmdA) has previously been used as a marker gene for the succinate pathway [14]. We wanted to know whether mmdA gene similarity was a good predictor for succinate consumption. To answer this, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of mmdA sequences from GTDB and tested a selection of isolates from along the tree for their ability to consume succinate (Supplementary Figure S1b). All the four genera identified in the enrichments could consume succinate in monoculture in the same in vitro conditions (Supplementary Figure S1c). However, the majority of the other tested isolates did not consume meaningful amounts of succinate, despite closely related mmdA genes (Supplementary Figure S1c). This suggests that the presence of a homologous mmdA gene—or even the complete succinate pathway as in many Bacteroidetes—is not sufficient to confer the ability to consume extracellular succinate in the tested conditions. Together with the fecal enrichments, these results suggest that extracellular succinate consumption in human fecal samples is constrained to very few taxa that include the four genera identified here.

The in vitro enrichments essentially test for the competitive ability of the bacteria that comprise the fecal microbiota for succinate. The outcome of such a competition is influenced by two key factors: (i) the per capita rate at which the taxa consume succinate and (ii) the population size of each taxon in the inoculum.

To test whether the identified taxa differ in their per capita succinate consumption rate, we performed in vitro cultures of eleven representative isolates in a growth medium supplemented with 80 mM succinate and measured the decrease in succinate concentration and the resulting bacterial growth over time (Fig. 2a). The representative isolates included two from the genus Dialister (D. hominis and D. invisus), four from Phascolarctobacterium (4x P. faecium), one from Phascolarctobacterium_A (P. succinatutens), and three from the genus Flavonifractor (3x F. plautii). We then estimated the succinate consumption rates of each isolate by deriving a substrate consumption and growth model and subsequently fitting it to the succinate concentration and optical density data in a Bayesian framework (Fig. 2a and the “Methods” section).

The mathematical model provided a good fit to the experimental data for the Dialister, Phascolarctobacterium, and Phascolarctobacterium_A isolates (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Figure S2). This confirms that these bacteria directly use the energy from converting succinate to propionate for growth. In contrast, the model was not a good fit to the data for Flavonifractor for which we observed diauxic growth with a first phase without appreciable succinate consumption (Supplementary Figure S3). To account for this diauxie, we expanded the model to include a second preferred but unobserved growth substrate (Fig. 2a). Only once this substrate was depleted does succinate consumption start. This updated model proved a much better fit to the data (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Figure S3). With the estimated model parameters at hand, we then compared the strains based on their per capita succinate consumption rate.

The estimated succinate uptake rates were consistent within genera but differed strongly between genera (Fig. 2c). Phascolarctobacterium strains consumed succinate at twice the rate compared to Dialister strains, with 63.7 mM/h/OD on average and 30.7 mM/h/OD on average, respectively. This translates to longer times required to consume all of the supplemented succinate for the Dialister cultures compared to the Phascolarctobacterium cultures given equal inoculum densities. Flavonifractor strains had an even lower uptake rate, with 11.5 mM/h/OD on average. However, this did not translate to substantially longer times required to consume the supplied succinate because the Flavonifractor cultures first grew on an alternative preferred resource and thus initiate succinate consumption at substantially larger cell densities. This can explain why Flavonifractor is more strongly enriched in the fecal microbiomes M8-M12 compared to Dialister despite slower per capita uptake rate. Overall, these results confirm that the observed differences in the rate of succinate consumption between the whole fecal microbiomes can be mapped to differences in uptake rates of the succinate consuming bacteria.

Having demonstrated that the succinate consumption rate differs between taxa, we next asked to what degree the starting abundances of the succinate consumers might have impacted the overall consumption rate. We thus quantified the relative abundance of the four genera in the thirteen fecal microbiota.
