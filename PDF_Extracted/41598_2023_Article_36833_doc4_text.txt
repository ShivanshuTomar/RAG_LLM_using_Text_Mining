# Correlation between shared specific genes associated with RA-specific gut microbiome and immune infiltration

We performed two immunoinvasive correlation analyses for this study. First, we combined the tagged genomes of several immune cell subpopulations in the CIBERSORT, a deconvolution method to determine the proportion of 22 types of immune cells (reported in previous studies). In the meantime, we quantified the infiltration abundances of the 24 immune cells (reported in earlier studies) in these samples using ssGSEA based on the R package “GSVA”. Finally, the association between immune cell infiltration in the RA training set, CD dataset, UC dataset, and RA validation set and shared specific genes connected to the gut microbiota in RA was analyzed using Spearman analysis.

# Results

# Screening of candidate genes associated with RA and IBD

Before analysis, batch effect reduction was applied to the GSE55235 and GSE55457 data sets (the RA training set), and PCA was used to evaluate and compare the features. Before the batch effect was removed, the data were dispersed as data sets, and it was visible (Fig. 2A). The overall expression of the data was distributed in the form of sample treatment (normal and RA) and published more evenly than before after the batch effect was removed (Fig. 2B).

To construct a RA scale-free network, the soft threshold (R2 = 0.85) was set to 9 (Fig. 3A). To construct a CD scale-free network, the soft threshold (R2 = 0.85) was set to 5 (Fig. 3C). To construct a UC scale-free network, the soft threshold (R2 = 0.85) was set to 6 (Fig. 3E). Finally, the WGCNA revealed 28 gene modules associated with the occurrence of RA in the RA training set (Fig. 3B). Each module was identified using a different color. Genes in the “blue” module had a significant positive association with RA (blue module: r = 0.82, P = 1e − 11; Fig. 3G; Supplementary Tables S1, S2, Supplementary Spreadsheet S3). The “royal blue” module was among the 52 modules identified in the CD dataset (Fig. 3D) that had a significant positive association with CD (royal blue module: r = 0.74, P = 4e − 07; Fig. 3H; Supplementary Tables S4, S5, Supplementary Spreadsheet S6). The “yellow-green” module was among the 57 modules identified in the UC dataset (Fig. 3F) that had a significant positive association with UC (yellow-green module: r = 0.78, P = 3e − 10; Fig. 3I; Supplementary Tables S7, S8, Supplementary Spreadsheet S9). A total of 15 candidate genes associated with both RA and IBD were identified after the intersection of genes in the abovementioned target modules: CXCL9, CCL18, CXCL10, S100A9, MMP9, RARRES3, S100A8, FCN1, ISG20, LILRB2, IDO1, CD19, CIITA, SIRPG, and DUOX2 (Fig. 3J).

# Construction of the PPI network of module genes and identification of hub genes

We entered 1266 module genes from the RA’s corresponding WGCNA module (Fig. 4A), 239 module genes from the CD’s corresponding WGCNA module (Fig. 4B), and 111 module genes from the UC’s corresponding WGCNA module (Fig. 4C) into the STRING database to visualize the PPI network to investigate further whether the 15 candidate shared genes are the hub genes of the corresponding WGCNA module of each disease. Subsequently, the string result table was entered into Cytoscape. The cytoHubba tool was used to search hub nodes in the network, and the top 5% of genes were selected as hub gene nodes using Degree. The score increases as the node color darkens, and the number of edge interactions increases as the line color increases. The hub genes of the WGCNA module corresponding to RA include CD19 and CXCL10 (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Spreadsheet S10). The hub genes of the WGCNA module corresponding to CD include CXCL10, LILRB2, and MMP9 (Fig. 4E; Supplementary Spreadsheet S10).

(A) PCA analysis was performed before batch effect elimination. (B) PCA analysis was performed after batch effect elimination. The GSE55235 dataset is red, and the GSE55457 dataset is blue. The triangular dots and the circular dots indicate samples from the RA and normal groups, respectively.
