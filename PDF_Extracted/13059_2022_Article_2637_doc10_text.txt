disease-associated ASVs. We then compared the UniDI (using a leave-one-out approach) to a previously published taxonomy-based CD dysbiosis index [2]. For the performance evaluation, we used a leave-one-out approach: we iterated over all disease cohorts, and for each iteration performed the analysis while leaving out a single validation disease cohort. The up _ nonspecific, down _ nonspecific ASV groups were identified as described above (see the “Identification of shared (“non-specific”) ASVs” section), but without the validation cohort (i.e., the non-specific ASVs were identified based on 58 disease cohorts). The resulting UniDI performed better than the CD dysbiosis index, indicating that UniDI can successfully differentiate between most cases and controls across a wide variety of diseases (Fig. 5C, Additional file 1: Fig. S5, and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). Among the UC/CD studies, UniDI showed more significant changes between cases and controls (10/14 studies) than CD dysbiosis index (7/14). Similar results were shown in other diseases such as Parkinson’s; UniDI succeeded to show significant changes in dysbiosis index in 2 out of 3 studies included in the meta-analysis, in comparison to 0 out of 3 in the CD dysbiosis index. These results indicate that UniDI can successfully differentiate between most cases and controls across a wide variety of diseases.

# Discussion

Our meta-analysis used a novel standardized pipeline starting from per-sample raw reads, across diverse pathologic conditions, different parts of the world, 28 diseases, and 12,838 subjects. We focused on studies that used the V4 regions, to facilitate comparison at the ASVs level rather than taxonomy and calculated the per ASV effect size between cases and controls within each original cohort, thus minimizing the study-specific signature. We identified a robust non-specific general disease response dominated by reduction of microbial ASVs (97 ASVs), with a smaller group of 31 bacterial ASVs being over-represented in disease. These non-specific microbial changes may reflect a general response of the body to pathologic conditions and therefore are less likely to be the main source of the chronic gut inflammation seen in IBD. Disease classifiers performed well in identifying many sick vs. healthy states, likely due to this general signal. We define a novel universal dysbiosis index (UniDI) utilizing the shared disease-associated ASVs, that can successfully differentiate between most cases and controls across a wide variety of diseases. Finally, we identified a set of IBD-specific taxa (most of which are salivary bacteria [2], with an increased abundance in IBD), potentially implying a more direct causal association between those and IBD pathogenesis and gut inflammation. Interestingly, recent studies showed that ectopic displacement of oral bacteria in the gut environment resulted in dysbiosis and a decrease in Th17 cells and fecal IgA levels and an increase in the M1/M2 macrophage ratio, thereby promoting chronic inflammation [44].

Meta-analyses systematically compare several independent studies to capture consistent and specific signals across diseases, cohorts, populations, and protocols. The basic unit is the disease cohort rather than samples. Microbiome meta-analysis can take place at several levels; systemic review comparing the results without reanalyzing the raw data [4], reanalyzing the raw data but not focusing on a specific sequence, enabling only comparisons at the taxonomy level [5, 45], and lastly reanalyzing the raw data and focusing on a specific sequence that enables direct comparison within each cohort as performed here. Microbiome-related meta-analyses have already suggested some inconsistencies in
