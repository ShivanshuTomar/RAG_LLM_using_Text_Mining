between host and microbiota succinate metabolism in intestinal inflammatory diseases like IBD.

The discovery that only two taxonomic groups occupy the succinate niche in human intestinal microbiota is strikingly simple and somewhat unexpected given the wider diversity of intestinal bacteria that have been reported to consume succinate. These include, for example, *Clostridioides difficile and Clostridium kluyveri that convert succinate to butyrate [32, 33] or Veillonella parvula that decarboxylates succinate during lactate consumption [17]. However, these bacteria do not per se use succinate as a growth substrate, with the former two regenerating NAD+ and the latter increasing growth yield from lactate but not able to grow on succinate alone. This might be similar to how Flavonifractor plautii uses succinate in our data, with a comparatively low per capita consumption rate. In contrast, Phascolarctobacterium and Dialister generate energy for growth from the decarboxylation of succinate. Yet, because the energetic yield of converting succinate to propionate is low [34], there is limited selection pressure for bacteria to specialize on succinate consumption. This is further illustrated by those bacteria that encode the full succinate pathway, like Bacteroides sp., but mostly favor cutting short and excreting succinate instead of fully running the pathway to produce propionate [35]. Using succinate as a growth substrate has been observed for other taxa, including Propionigenium modestum [36] and Peptostreptococcus sp. [34], but given that (a) Phascolarctobacterium and Dialister* are de facto fully mutually exclusive and (b) the prevalence of either is close to 100% in humans, we posit that these two taxonomic groups have specialized specifically on succinate consumption in the human intestine. What the evolutionary process was that resulted in this arrangement, and whether there is more fine-scale strain-level diversity also within the two genera remains to be investigated.

It is also surprising, based on our results, that D-succinotypes are stable and are not invaded by *Phascolarctobacterium, given that its higher per capita succinate consumption rate should impart a fitness advantage over Dialister. We do note that a small minority of subjects in our fecal enrichments and also the public data have mixed succinotypes with comparable abundances of Dialister and Phascolarctobacterium*. Whether these are snapshots of a transient shift from one succinotype to the other and more generally what the ecological forces are that stably maintain a succinotype in an individual over time is yet to be uncovered.

To what degree the observed consumption rate differences translate to what happens in situ needs to be carefully evaluated. Our fecal enrichment approach was designed to probe bacterial competitive ability in the relevant background of the full complex microbiota but by design makes specific choices of the growth environment and also neglects the host. Indeed, the consumption of succinate is dependent on a number of cofactors, in particular vitamin B12 [37] and sodium [34, 36], and the specific local concentrations of these and other cofactors need not be the same in our lab setup and in humans. We do observe a decrease in succinate in all tested fecal samples, suggesting that our lab setup does allow for succinate consumption to occur, even though some of D-succinotype enrichment replicates did not consume succinate within the observation window. A more conservative interpretation of the difference in consumption rates is that *Phascolarctobacterium has a more robust succinate consumption system than Dialister* and is thus less dependent on externally supplied cofactors and conditions. Nevertheless, the observed higher fecal succinate concentrations in D-succinotype individuals compared to P-succinotypes despite equal population sizes is at least compatible with an in vivo difference in consumption rate.

Our results provide a rare mechanistic link between microbiome composition and function, and are a basis on which to functionally interpret compositional dysbiosis in disease. Differential abundances of both *Phascolarctobacterium and Dialister have been independently reported as associated with IBD but have mostly not been interpreted together. The first analyses of the OSCCAR and PRISM cohorts already reported Phascolarctobacterium as one of the two only genera that were significantly reduced in UC and CD patients [38] with no specific mention of Dialister, an observation independently confirmed in other cohorts [39, 40]. Subsequent studies also reported concomitant decreased abundances of Phascolarctobacterium and increased Dialister* between IBD patients and healthy controls [40, 41]. While these studies did point into the direction of a role of intestinal succinate in IBD, our classification into functionally different succinotypes now allows for a mechanistic interpretation of these consistent signals.

Attempting to classify human microbiota into different types is not new, the most prominent example being the “enterotypes” [42, 43]. Our succinotype classification differs from the enterotype classification in an important way: succinotypes are primarily informed by a functional phenotype, while enterotypes are informed by statistical differentiation of microbiome composition. While such statistical classification can be useful to reduce complex compositional differences into a simple grouping, there is per se no direct interpretation of what this grouping means. In contrast, the two succinotypes we describe here are based on succinate consumption rate and thus can be directly interpreted.
