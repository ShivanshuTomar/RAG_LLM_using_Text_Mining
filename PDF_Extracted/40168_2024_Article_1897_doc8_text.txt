Finally, the succinotype classification allows for a robust stratification of patients based on a clinically relevant feature. Clinical parameters can then be tested for association with disease. In our analysis, for example, fecal succinate concentrations are higher in IBD patients compared to healthy controls, but this difference is better explained by succinotype rather than disease status. Such biomarker-based patient stratification is a powerful tool to inform treatment decisions and ultimately improve treatment outcomes.

# Methods

# Stool collection

The research project was approved by the Ethic Committee of the Canton of Zurich (2017-01290). Fresh fecal samples were donated from 13 healthy individuals with no history of antibiotic use, intestinal infections, or severe diarrhea during the 3 months prior to making the donation. The donors did not take immunosuppressive drugs, blood thinners, or medication affecting the bowel passage or digestion. Fecal samples were anaerobically transported in an airtight container together with an Oxoid™ AnaeroGen™ 2.5 L sachet (Thermo Fisher Diagnostics AG, Pratteln, Switzerland) and processed within 3 h after defecation. Stool consistency was evaluated optically according to the Bristol Stool Scale [44], and samples within the defined range of a healthy stool, notably with a score between 3 and 5, were accepted.

# Preparation of anaerobic culture media

The growth medium was adapted from the M2GSC medium [45] for the in vitro enrichments of complex cultures as in Anthamatten et al. [22] and additionally also from YCFA [46] for single cultures. Briefly, in contrast to the common M2GSC and YCFA media, our basal medium did not contain any specific carbon sources, i.e., no glucose, starch, or cellobiose and had reduced concentrations of amicase (1 g/L), yeast extract (1.25 g/L), and meat extract (0.5 g/L). All medium ingredients except sodium bicarbonate and L-cysteine HCl were dissolved in an Erlenmeyer flask, and the pH was adjusted to pH 7 using 5 mM sodium hydroxide. The media were boiled for 15 min under constant moderate stirring to remove oxygen and using a Liebig condenser to prevent vaporization of ingredients. After boiling, the media were constantly flushed with CO2. Sodium bicarbonate and L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate were added when the media had cooled to 55 °C for further reduction of residual oxygen for 10 min. Aliquots of 8 mL of medium were filled into Hungate tubes under constant flushing with CO2, and Hungate tubes were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and screw caps (Millan SA, Geneva, Switzerland). The media were subsequently sterilized by autoclaving and stored at room temperature.

# Stool processing

The fecal samples were transferred into an anaerobic chamber (10% CO2, 5% H2, and 85% N2) (Coy Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). One gram of fecal sample measured with a sterile plastic spoon (VWR International, Dietikon, Switzerland) was suspended in 9 mL of anaerobic dilution solution (ADS). The dilution step was repeated and 1 mL of the resulting 100-fold dilution was transferred into 9 mL of ADS in a sterile Hungate tube. Serial dilutions down to 10−11 were continued outside of the anaerobic chamber under sterile anaerobic conditions using the Hungate technique to determine the total viable cells after transport using the most probably number method.

# Batch enrichments in succinate-rich conditions

Anaerobic in vitro enrichments were performed in Hungate tubes sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and screw caps (Millan SA, Geneva, Switzerland). For each enrichment, 0.3 mL of the 10−8 fecal sample dilution was inoculated into 8 mL of cultivation medium in Hungate tubes. Enrichments were performed for each of the 13 studied microbiota in three replicate cultures in a basal medium supplemented with 30 mM of disodium succinate and in a non-supplemented control condition. The media were buffered at an initial pH of 6.5. All cultures were incubated at 37 °C for up to 7 days. The optical densities were measured at 600 nm directly in the Hungate tubes with a WPA CO 8000 Cell Density Meter (Biochrom Ltd, Cambridge, England).

# Microbial metabolite analysis

Succinate concentrations were measured by HPLC analysis. Samples were prepared from 1 mL of bacterial culture centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered into 2 mL short thread vials with crimp caps (VWR International GmbH, Schlieren, Switzerland) using non-sterile 0.2 μm regenerated cellulose membrane filters (Phenomenex Inc., Aschaffenburg, Germany). A volume of 40 μL of sample was injected into the HPLC with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min at a constant column temperature of 80 °C and using a mixture of H2SO4 (10 mM) and Na-azide (0.05 g/L) as eluent. Analyses were performed with a Hitachi Chromaster 5450 RI-Detector (VWR International GmbH, Schlieren, Switzerland) using a Rezex ROA-Organic Acid (4 %) precolumn connected to a Rezex ROA-Organic Acid (8 %) column, equipped with a Security Guard Carbo-H cartridge (4 × 3 mm). Metabolite concentrations were determined using external standards (all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich).
