anaerobes, leading to gut microbiota dysbiosis [10, 11]. The fecal microbiomes of IBD patients reflect an oxidative stress response with enriched transcription of genes involved in sulfate transport, as well as cysteine and glutathione metabolism [12]. Although modulation of ROS may aid in the restoration of intestinal homeostasis, the GI tract microenvironment is also complicated, requiring local drug release to ensure prolonged efficacy. At present, antioxidant therapies that involve small-molecule drugs have demonstrated restricted efficacy in terms of the durability of ROS modulation and may lead to severe complications (autoimmunity, organ damage, and opportunistic infections) and off-target systemic side effects [13–15]. Thus, alternative methods are highly sought for to break through these limitations for enhancing IBD treatment efficacy.

Recently, the utilization of nanoparticles as drug carriers customized with various ligands to generate amplified localized drug concentrations around IBD lesions is a potential technique to overcome the limitations of conventional drug therapy [16–20]. Polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles is a melanin-like polymer derived from the oxidative self-polymerization of dopamine monomers [21]. PDA exhibits remarkable redox ability owing to its abundant reductive groups such as catechol and quinone moieties. These properties enable PDA to alleviate oxidative stress by releasing electrons, thereby positioning it a potential ROS scavenger for treating IBD [22]. Additionally, due to its colloidal stability, conductivity, and strong wet adhesion to virtually all types of surfaces that irrespective of the substrate’s chemistry, PDA has extensive applications in surface coating, cell or tissue adhesion, and molecule immobilization [23, 24]. Typically, the catechol groups of PDA, which are abundant in mussel adhesive foot proteins, possess the robust mucosa adhesive properties, resulting in an extended duration of retention within the intestinal tract [25]. Meanwhile, PDA coatings have been observed to possess zwitterionic properties, facilitating nano system penetration of mucus and enhancing cellular uptake by interacting with the positively charged choline groups situated on the epithelial cell membrane [26, 27]. Besides, PDA nanoparticles have the potential to regulate intestinal inflammation through various mechanisms, including the promotion of regulatory T (Treg) cells, inhibition of dendritic cell activation, and suppression of the differentiation of naïve T cells into effector T helper (Th) cells such as Th1, Th2, and Th17 [28]. Hence, the above attributes collectively position PDA as an ideal candidate for developing innovative therapeutic approaches in IBD treatment.

Although diminishing exaggerated immune responses that partially caused by ROS is essential in the management of IBD patients, gut microbiota perturbations also promote tissue damage and aberrant host immune responses. As a result, the concomitant utilization of immunogenic suppressant therapy and the manipulation of microbial homeostasis has led to a synergistic suppression of intestinal inflammation [29, 30]. Yeast β-glucan isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a glucose polymer with a linear β (1,3)-glucan backbone with β (1,6)-linked side chains [31]. Extensive research has been conducted on its health benefits, and its biological activity is much higher than that of other β-glucans [32]. In particular, evidence suggests that yeast β-glucans-based treatments may have potential to improve cognition in neurodegenerative disease, attenuate obesity via altering the composition and richness of the gut microbiota [33, 34]. Recently, low molecular weight yeast β-glucans were found to reduce macrophage infiltration, mucosal damage, and colonic inflammation induced by DSS in mice [35]. Although various yeast β-glucan extractions have been utilized to treat IBD and other diseases, there is a paucity of literature on the prophylactic and therapeutic impacts of nanotherapeutics derived from yeast β-glucans on colonic diseases, encompassing immunomodulatory effects and gut microbiota regulation. Therefore, the development of redox-active nanoparticles possesses the capability of both alleviating ROS overproduction and restoring the normal homeostasis of the gut microbiota under environmental with the aim of restructuring a healthy immune microenvironment, represents a promising strategy in IBD therapy.

# Synthesis and characterization of YBNs@PDA

Generally, YBNs@PDA was prepared by self-assembly of YBNs followed by surface coating with PDA (Fig. 1A; Additional file 1: Fig. S1A). Briefly, yeast β-glucan (YBG) was first modified with formate group as intermediates.
