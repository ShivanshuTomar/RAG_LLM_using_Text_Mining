# Weighted gene co-expression network analysis

WGCNA is a standard method for processing large amounts of data that permits the grouping and modularization of a collection of genes most closely related to disease onset. The “WGCNA” R package was used in the study to build the gene co-expression network 32.

The gene expression matrix is first entered into the R software to check for missing data and identify outliers. Next, we developed a scale-free network to select a soft threshold value for each disease, which is used as the parameter cut-off value for creating the adjacency and topology matrices. Next, gene co-expression modules for each disease were identified using the block modules function and module division analysis. Each module was associated with these diseases (RA, CD, and UC), and the Pearson correlation coefficients were used to filter the most relevant modules. The genes in these modules were classified as genes associated with diseases. Finally, the Venn diagram package 33 was used to overlap module genes associated with RA, CD, and UC to screen for shared candidate genes. The analysis images of WGCNA are generated by R software. R software is open source software, and the various packages are free and open source.

# Building a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network for module genes and identifying hub genes

The PPI network of module genes for each disease was investigated using the interaction relation in
