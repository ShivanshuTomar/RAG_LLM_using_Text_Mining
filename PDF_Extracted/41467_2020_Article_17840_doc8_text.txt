reads to a customized database of functionally annotated pan-genomes. FDR of cohort-specific co-abundances using 100× permutations as described above.

HUMAnN2 reported the abundances of gene families from the UniProt Reference Clusters78 (UniRef90), which were further mapped to microbial pathways from the MetaCyc metabolic pathway database79,80. In total, we detected 698 species and 489 pathways present in at least 1 of the 4 cohorts. To deal with sparse microbial data in the network analysis, we focused on species/pathways present in at least 20% of samples in at least one cohort. This provided a confined list of 134 species and 343 pathways for use in the network analysis. Together these accounted for, on average, 86.9% and 99.9% of taxonomic and functional compositions, respectively.

# Statistical analysis

Co-abundance network inference: co-abundance analysis on compositional data is challenging because it is likely to exhibit spurious correlations due to the dependency of fractions (i.e. relative abundance sums to 1)29,81–84. In particular, the problem can be more serious in a microbial community with low compositionality85. We therefore first assessed the inverse Simpson index of microbial composition for the effective number of species (neff). Our analysis showed high compositionality in both functional pathway composition (2.09, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.08 in LLD, 500FG, 300OB and IBD, respectively) and species composition (10.74, 11.87, 12.30 and 8.80 in LLD, 500FG, 300OB and IBD, respectively).

Following the suggestion of Weiss et al.85, based on their assessment of the performance of eight different methods (Bray–Curtis, Pearson, Spearman, CoNet, LSA, MIC, RMT and SparCC), we decided to use the SparCC method because it has been proven to be able to infer linear relationships with high precision for high diversity compositions with neff < 13. Species composition data from MetaPhlan was converted to predicted read counts by multiplying relative abundances by the total sequence counts and then subjected to a Python-based SparCC tool29. For pathway analysis, the read counts from HUMAnN2 were directly used for SparCC. Significant co-abundance was controlled at FDR 0.05 level using 100× permutation.

In each permutation, the abundance of each microbial factor was randomly shuffled across samples. To reduce indirect associations, we further applied SpiecEasi (v1.0.6), which infers the microbial network underlying graphical model using the concept of conditional independence38. In this way, we obtained 3454 species and 43,355 pathway co-abundances that were detectable by both methods (Fig. 1).

# Replication of microbial networks

To replicate microbial networks in IBD, we used data from 77 IBD patients from the iHMP-IBD as a replication cohort88. Given the iHMP-IBD’s longitudinal study design, we could examine metagenomics data from the first and the last sample collection for each individual. In all, 91% of the species (123 out of 134) and 99% of the pathways (340 out of 343) found in our IBD cohort were also detected in the first sample collection in iHMP-IBD.

The differences in co-abundance strength between the IBD cohort and the iHMP-IBD cohort were assessed using Cochran-Q test. A significant P > 0.05 was applied to define replicable co-abundances. We also investigated the stability of microbial networks in iHMP-IBD by comparing the microbial co-abundances in the first and last sample collection from the same participants using the same approach.

To replicate microbial networks in 300OB, we selected 134 obese individuals from the LLD cohort with matched age and BMI. Here we considered a co-abundance to be replicable if the Cochran-Q test heterogeneity between the discovery and replication cohorts was not significant at P > 0.05.

# Network heterogeneity analysis

To assess the variability of networks among the four cohorts, we conducted Cochran-Q tests to assess the heterogeneity of effect sizes and directions across the four cohorts for each co-abundance (correlation coefficient generated by SparCC) and co-occurrence (odds ratio). Here we treated each cohort as one study and conducted the Cochran-Q test using the metagen() function from the package meta (v4.9.5) in R, which calculates the squared difference between individual study effects and the pooled effect using inverse variance weighting86.

For each co-abundance, the P values from the Cochran-Q test were recorded, and co-abundances with significant heterogeneity were controlled at the FDR 0.05 level determined by permutation (100×). In this case, all samples from the four cohorts were randomly shuffled across cohorts, i.e. shuffling the cohort labels but keeping the correlation structure of species and pathways intact. Co-abundances with a Cochran-Q test FDR < 0.05 were considered heterogeneous, while co-abundances with Cochran-Q test P > 0.05 were considered stable.

We also summarized species co-abundance co-abundances based on microbial genus and pathway co-abundance co-abundances based on metabolic category.

# Cohort-specific co-abundance selection

For heterogeneous co-abundances and co-occurrences (Cochran-Q test FDR < 0.05), we further assessed whether these relationships showed cohort specificity, i.e. whether the effect size of co-abundance/co-occurrence in one cohort was very different from that in the other three. In this analysis, effect size for co-abundance was the SparCC correlation coefficient and the odds ratio for co-occurrence. We adopted interquartile ranges (IQRs) based on the outlier detection method (Supplementary Fig. 10)87.

We ranked the effect sizes from low to high, say b1, b2, b3, b4, and then calculated the corresponding 25%, 50% and 75% quartile values (Q1, Q2 and Q3, respectively). IQR was then calculated, and we assessed whether the smallest or largest effect size fell outside of Q1 − 2 × IQR or Q3 + 2 × IQR. If only one met the condition, we called this co-abundance specific and assigned it to the corresponding cohort (Supplementary Fig. 10).

To assess whether cohort-specific co-abundances were enriched for a specific cohort, we conducted Fisher’s exact test. We also calculated the average.
