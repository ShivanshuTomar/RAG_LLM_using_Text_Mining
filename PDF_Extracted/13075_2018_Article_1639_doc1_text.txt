# Background

Spondyloarthritis (SpA), characterized by inflammation of vertebral and peripheral joints sometimes progressing to fusion of the sacroiliac joints, affects up to 1% of the population and includes the diseases ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related SpA. While symptoms start in the second and third decade of life, there are no disease-specific biomarkers, often causing delays in diagnosis resulting in increased functional impairment and disability [1]. IBD, which is significantly associated with SpA, is characterized by relapsing and remitting intestinal inflammation and can be subdivided into Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Affecting up to 0.5% of the population, IBD also lacks a disease-specific biomarker and results in substantial morbidity [2]. The clinical overlap of SpA with IBD, and observations of reactive arthritis triggered by intestinal pathogens, suggest a shared pathogenesis between the two diseases, which is likely driven by genetic susceptibility and an environmental trigger provided by intestinal microbes [3].

The most frequently cited genetic susceptibility for SpA is conferred with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I allele HLA-B27, which is found in 85% of individuals with axial SpA (axSpA). In non-axial SpA the presence of HLA-B27 positivity is much lower. For example, in those with IBD-associated SpA, 63% are HLA-B27+ [4]. HLA-B27 positivity is thought to result in altered recognition and handling of bacterial antigens [5, 6]. Some evidence also links IL-23 receptor variants to susceptibility risk for both axSpA and IBD. IL-23 acts as a regulator of cellular immunity by promoting a T helper (Th)17 response [7], which develops at the intestinal mucosa in the presence of commensal bacteria [8]. Thus, there appears to be an association between genetic susceptibility, intestinal microbiota, and the mucosal immune response in the pathophysiology of both axSpA and IBD.

In addition to association with genes involved in altered recognition and handling of bacterial antigens, both axSpA [9–11] and IBD [12, 13] have a well-known association with dysbiosis (alteration in microbiota)—a finding that extends to newly diagnosed and untreated patients [14]. However, the effect of dysbiosis on disease onset, progression, and recurrence is unclear [12]. It is possible that dysbiosis-mediated alteration in mucosal immune cell function plays a key role in disease pathogenesis.

We have previously shown that the function of colonic intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) is altered by dysbiosis in mice [15]. The epithelium is the most superficial layer of the alimentary tract and as such, would be expected to be affected to the greatest degree by alterations in the microbiome. Thus, IELs serve as prime targets to study how changes in resident bacteria influence immune response. These cells have the contradictory role of tolerating colonization by resident bacteria while still mounting a prompt and robust immune response against invading pathogens [16]. Moreover, intraepithelial lymphocytosis has a well-known association with other immune-mediated diseases of the gut including lymphocytic colitis, celiac disease, autoimmune enteropathy, and allergic colitis [17, 18]. Unlike those in healthy individuals, IELs from patients with IBD do not down-regulate proliferative responses of primed allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells on re-challenge with antigens [19]. Thus, dysregulation of IELs may provide new insights into the influence the microbiome has on systemic and mucosal immunity.

In this study, we hypothesized that alterations in microbiota in axSpA and IBD would be associated with functional changes in colonic IELs. Specifically, we examined total number and type of IELs and individual cytokine secretion by IELs, and we completed an exploratory analysis of microbiome interaction with IELs and cytokine secretion. We found unique patterns of IEL phenotype, cytokine expression, and cytokine-microbiome interactions by disease state that begin to elucidate how the microbiome affects immunity.

# Methods

# Study population and design

This study utilized a case-control study design. Control participants were recruited from the routine endoscopy schedule at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, Colorado from March 2015 to January 2017; these subjects were undergoing colonoscopy for colon cancer screening (at age 50 years or younger if a family history of colon cancer is present) or due to changes in bowel habits. Subjects were included only if they were negative for malignancy and inflammation on biopsies. Patients with IBD (cases) were recruited if undergoing disease activity assessment or colon cancer or dysplasia screening; only those negative for cancer or dysplasia were included in the study. Patients with AxSpA (cases) were recruited to undergo an elective flexible sigmoidoscopy (n = 4) or underwent colonoscopy due to symptoms of a change in bowel habits (n = 2). Those with change in bowel habits were only included when the endoscopic exam and colonic and ileal biopsies excluded IBD. Fifteen biopsies were taken from endoscopically non-inflamed portions of the left colon (descending, sigmoid, and rectum) so as to avoid the confounding effect of inflammation, as IEL number has previously been shown to increase in active colitis [20]. Patients were eligible if they had biopsy-proven IBD or axSpA fulfilling the 2009 Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria [21]; individuals with an overlap of both IBD and
