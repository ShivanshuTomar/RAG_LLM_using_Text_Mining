FMT is a direct example of clinically applied bacteriotherapy and became popular with the spread of microbiota analysis using next-generation sequencing technology called 16S rRNA sequencing. Numerous RCTs have proven FMT efficacy against rCDI, and meta-analysis also demonstrated their effectiveness [62, 63]. In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of FMT after rigorous informed consent and the approval of the ethical review board at the given healthcare facility. In North America, there is a drive to encapsulate feces, and promising results have been obtained treating rCDI with orally administered fecal capsules [64]. Fecal capsules promote the spread of FMT, but it is unclear whether processed capsules qualify under the Investigational New Drug (IND) application.

A German group, in contrast, took a unique therapeutic approach with five rCDI patients. First, third-party donor-derived bacteria were suspended in saline, filtered to prevent the passage of bacteria, and administered as a non-bacterial supernatant to the patient (fecal filtrate transfer; FFT). Surprisingly, in all 5 patients, FFT restored normal stool habits and eliminated symptoms of CDI, suggesting that there is no need for conventional FMT—but, the supernatant contained a critical healing factor other than bacteria in donor feces [65]. It is possible that the critical curing factor was a metabolite or bacteriophage produced by microbiota derived from healthy donors. At present, FMT is being tested for various diseases associated with dysbiosis [66–74]. As for efficacy, in particular, it remains controversial whether FMT has a beneficial effect on active UC or not. An Australian group demonstrated that intensive-dosing (5 days per week for 8 weeks), multi-donor (between three and seven unrelated donors) FMT induces clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in active UC [66]. To the contrary, our group demonstrated that single FMT using feces derived from single-donor of each patients’ relative has a limited effect on UC in Japanese patients [74]. This discrepancy may occur due to difficulty in restoring bacterial flora by single administration. On the other hand, as for safety, the establishment of FMT must reiterate the safety of donor feces, the mechanism of the symbiotic ecosystem between microbiota and human host, the metabolites produced by microbiota, and the other microorganisms, such as bacteriophages and fungi, coexisting in the feces.

# Defined microbiota

The long-term safety of donor feces for use during FMT is still unclear. Just because the donor is a healthy person, one cannot conclude that the donor feces do not have unknown infectious agents. A Canadian group is mass-cultivating anaerobic probiotics from the feces of healthy donors using “Robogut,” a robot that mimics the conditions in the colon; the group has developed a high-volume probiotics suspension composed of 33 types of bacteria [75]. It has already been reported that the bacterial cocktail shows positive effects in rCDI patients, although the trial is small [76]. These researchers used a precise process to prevent the contamination of pathogens, as with yogurt. While the safety concerns in FMT, defined microbiota, which uses probiotics from processed feces for therapeutic purposes, is treated as a drug; it therefore must be strictly studied under clinical development regulations and with an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. In 2016, the FDA revised guidelines for bacterial therapy for pharmaceutical purposes, which were different from conventional treatment with healthy food such as yogurt.

# Postbiotics

With the rapid accumulation of information on genes (metagenomics) and metabolites (metabolomics) related to microbiota, researchers are attempting to apply the metabolite produced by microbiota itself. This process is called “postbiotics,” and research has been actively promoted in recent years. Other examples of postbiotics include molecules that modify metabolite production. For example, a molecule that inhibits an enzyme that produces trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which promotes arteriosclerosis, is being researched as a postbiotic [77]. While these approaches are in the early stages, pharmaceutical research is rapidly growing.

# Probiotics and gut immunity

It is known that the gut microbiome has a close relationship with immune cells in the lamina propria and substantially contributes to intestinal diseases [2, 4, 6, 12, 14, 78–80]. Each probiotic bacterial strain shapes unique characteristics of the immune response (Fig. 2). In one mouse model, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) IL-17A produce Th17 cells through the production of serum amyloid A (SAA) from intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) [81]. Some microbiota belonging to the genus Clostridium induce regulatory T cells (Treg) by producing butyrate from dietary fiber, and in turn, the butyrate suppresses inflammatory cytokines via mucin and antimicrobial peptide from IEC [4, 34, 35, 82, 83]. Consistently, another butyrate-producing Clostridium strain, Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588, suppresses colitis via IL-10 production from intestinal macrophages and TGF-beta from dendritic cells [5, 56]. These findings are consistent with those of recent human studies. The fecal butyrate levels and the proportion of Clostridia are significantly lower in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) than in healthy controls [31, 84, 85]. We recently reported the efficacy of herbal medicine, indigo naturalis, in patients with active UC, which is accompanied by corrected gut microbiota [29].
