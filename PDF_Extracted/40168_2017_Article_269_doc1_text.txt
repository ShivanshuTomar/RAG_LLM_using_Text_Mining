# Background

Gut microbiota play a key role in maintaining homeostatic host functions, and deleterious shifts in the gut microbial ecosystem, often referred to as dysbiosis, are associated with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and other systemic inflammatory conditions [1]. A diverse gut microbial community confers colonization resistance against pathogens such as C. difficile, and disruption of a diverse community structure from antibiotics, comorbidities, altered gastrointestinal transit, or other risk factors can lead to pathogen colonization and infection [2].

With increasing incidence of community and hospital acquired CDI, high rates of recurrent CDI (estimated 20–30% after a first and 50–60% after a third infection), high mortality (~29,000 deaths annually) in the USA, and an urgent need for newer non-antibiotic therapies has led to the emergence of microbiome-based therapies [3]. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in CDI patients restores phylogenetic diversity to levels more typical of a healthy person, with response rates >85% by enema, oral capsule, or endoscopic delivery modes [4–6]. A recent study suggests significantly lower response of CDI to FMT in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [7]. We have also previously described a higher rate of recurrence of CDI following FMT in patients with CDI and underlying IBD [8]. It remains unclear if changes in gut microbial ecology play a role in long-term success of FMT in these patients.

FMT has not shown consistent success in treating other diseases associated with microbial dysbiosis such as IBD. Three clinical trials to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) with FMT have shown conflicting results, and one highlighted the potential role of specific gut microbial members in donor stool in determining success after FMT in UC [9–11]. The underlying host or donor factors that may be important for success of FMT in treatment of IBD remain unclear.

In this study, we assessed the effect of donor type (standard donor versus related donor) and changes in gut microbial ecology on response to FMT in recurrent CDI with and without underlying IBD as well as clinical response to FMT.

# Methods

# Patient selection

Patients undergoing FMT for recurrent CDI were prospectively recruited in this study. Informed consent was obtained to collect clinical data and stool samples. Data collected included demographics, clinical history, CDI treatment history, comorbid conditions, and response to FMT. A donor fecal sample was collected prior to FMT. Stool samples from the recipients were collected before FMT, and at day 7 and day 28, and were stored at −80 °C. The donors were either related (genetically related family members) or unrelated (screened hospital employee volunteer donors or unrelated family members), and a fresh sample was obtained on the day of FMT. All donors underwent extensive screening in accordance with standard practice and guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration [12]. Donor selection criteria and experience from our group have been previously published [13]. The donor stool sample is weighed and divided into 50 g aliquots. Each aliquot of 50 g is diluted in normal saline in a 1:5 ratio (50 g of stool diluted with 250 ml of normal saline) and is placed in the blender bag (a two-bag system with a semipermeable membrane in the inner bag and the outside bag is plastic). The stool is placed in the inner bag and normal saline is added. The bag is placed in a sealed compartment in the stomacher 400 (Seward) and blended for 60 s at 230 rotations per minute. The filtrate is then placed into 50 ml conical tubes using 50 ml pipettes and placed on an ice pack prior to the procedure. Recurrent CDI was defined as another episode of CDI within 56 days after symptom resolution with recurrence of symptoms and a positive stool polymerase chain reaction test. For this study, future C. difficile episodes after FMT up to 2 years were captured. These were categorized as up to 56 days, 56 days to 1 year, and beyond 1 year.

# Sequencing and analytic methods

After fecal DNA isolation (MoBio, Carlsbad, CA fecal DNA kit), amplicons spanning the variable region 4 of bacterial 16S rRNA were generated and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform at the Mayo Clinic Medical Genome Facility, Rochester, MN. The 16S rRNA sequencing data from the Illumina runs were quality controlled, trimmed, demultiplexed, and assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) following the closed reference at 97% similarity (using SortMeRNA as a clustering algorithm [14] protocol against the Greengenes [15] database 13_8 release, as implemented in Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) 1.9.0 software [16], default parameters were used for all these steps unless otherwise noted. After quality control, 10,583,052 sequences were obtained, for a mean of 76,688 sequences per sample (min: 33,559, max: 154,200).

Alpha diversity values were calculated using Faith’s phylogenetic diversity [17]. To assess differential abundance between the groups, we used ANCOM [18], as implemented in scikit-bio 0.5.1 (http://scikit-bio.org/docs/0.5.1/). This is tested by looking at the individual OTUs across the patient types (with and without underlying IBD); OTUs of the same genus are grouped for displaying purposes. We note that ANCOM makes the statistical assumption that fewer than 25% of taxa change, not met in all these comparisons (before FMT and post FMT communities are expected to be very different [19]). The donor plane is created.
