# Fig. 2 Succinate-consuming gut bacteria differ in their succinate uptake rate.

a To estimate the rate at which different representative isolates consume succinate, we performed replicate cultures of a panel of eleven isolates in media supplemented with 80 mM of succinate as the primary carbon source. Each replicate culture was destructively sampled at a different time point between 0 and 60 h. We then estimated the succinate uptake rate by fitting a mathematical model of succinate uptake and growth to the data. We accounted for the observed diauxic growth of Flavonifractor sp. by adding a second (unobserved) resource to the model (blue terms).

b Experimental data and model fits for one representative isolate of each genus. For each isolate, two biological replicate “sets” were inoculated (circles and triangles). Initial bacterial concentrations, x0 and succinate concentrations, A0, were estimated separately for each replicate set and are shown as separate lines. Data for Flavonifractor isolates used the diauxic model.

c Posterior mean estimates (bars) and 90% highest-probability density intervals (black lines) for the eleven strains. P1: P. faecium DSMZ 14760; P2: P. faecium PB-SDVAP; P3: P. faecium PB-SJWFW; P4: P. faecium PB-SPUPY; P5: P. succinatutens DSMZ 22533; D1: D. hominis DSMZ 109768; D2: D. invisus PB-SARUR; D2: D. succinatiphilus DSMZ 21274; F1: F. plautii DSMZ 24814; F2: F. plautii PB-SCBYV; F3: F. plautii PB-SSJQB.

Different compositional pattern than Flavonifractor (Fig. 3a). The former three all had a bimodal abundance distribution in the fecal samples and were either present at 1–7% or otherwise undetectable. In contrast, Flavonifractor was detected in all thirteen fecal microbiota at a consistent abundance of 0.01–0.4%. Because Flavonifractor only consumes succinate as a secondary preference, we hypothesized that the bimodal prevalence of the three “primary” consuming genera was the result of mutual exclusion from strong substrate competition. If this was the case, then each fecal sample should only harbor one of the three consumers. Indeed, each of the thirteen fecal microbiota only had one dominant primary succinate consumer (Fig. 3b), in most cases with full mutual exclusion (at the sensitivity of sequencing), and this pattern of mutual exclusion also occurred at the species (Fig. 3c) and ASV level (Supplementary Figure S4).

The clear association between the dominant primary succinate consumer and inoculum microbiota indicates that different human intestinal microbiota might be well-classified by the identity of their primary succinate degrader: their “succinotype.” Based on the patterns observed here, we introduce the “P” and “D” succinotypes for fecal microbiota that have either Phascolarctobacterium/Phascolarctobacterium_A or Dialister, respectively (Fig. 3c). For the P succinotype, we grouped the two genera together because of both their phylogenetic proximity and similarity in per capita uptake rate. We next asked whether such a classification of human microbiomes into succinotypes was robust beyond the 13 tested fecal microbiota.

# Succinotypes appear broadly across human cohorts and are associated with disease

To test whether our classification of succinotypes was generalizable to fecal human microbiota more broadly, we analyzed nine publicly available cohorts of 16S amplicon human fecal microbiome data comprising a total of 11,885 samples [23–27]. Furthermore, we also analyzed 85 cohorts with shotgun metagenomic data from the curated Metagenomic Data collection [28]. We used a consistent taxonomic classification based on the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB r95) [29].
