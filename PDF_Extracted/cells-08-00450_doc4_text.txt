by IECs that initiate and improve wound healing after mucosal injury [55, 56]. Consistently, butyrate manifests its anti-inflammatory properties by influencing intestinal immune cells, such as dendritic cells [57], macrophages, and T cells [58]. In this regard, butyrate leads to the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by LPS-stimulated macrophages that polarize T cells such as IL-23 and IL-12p70 and IL-6 [59, 60]. Furthermore, butyrate and propionate seem to play a role in inhibiting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) by inhibition of HDAC in DCs [61, 62]. Butyrate and propionate promote B cell differentiation into antibody-producing cells by accelerating metabolism and regulating gene expression [63]. Butyrate also modulates mucosal inflammation by regulating colonic Tregs [64]. The inhibition of HDACs by butyrate induces the differentiation of Tregs, by increasing the acetylation of histone H3 of FOXP3 promoter [65–69]. A more recent study [70] reported that butyrate acts via its HDAC3 inhibitory function to alter metabolism and induce production of anti-microbial peptides, leading to enhanced bactericidal function in vitro and in vivo. Another mechanism by which butyrate reduces intestinal inflammation is through the reduction of cell infiltration, by decreasing the expression of surface receptors for chemoattractants such as C5aR and CXCR2 [71].

# 5.2. Tryptophan Metabolites

In a murine model of colitis, dietary supplementation with tryptophan and tryptophan metabolite reduces the signs of colitis [72]. Conversely, mice fed with a tryptophan-deficient diet are more susceptible to the develop colitis [72]. Moreover, IBD patients exhibited lower levels of serum tryptophan, as compared to healthy controls [73]. Additionally, mRNA expression level of Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase-1, the first step in the kynurenine pathway, is upregulated in human and murine colonic tissues [73, 74]. Microbes use tryptophan as an energy source to produce ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) [75], which is necessary for the maintenance of the epithelial barrier and the proper function intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) [76, 77]. Indeed, loss of AhR aggravates the intestinal inflammation in mice treated with DSS and the transfer of IELs to AhR−/− mice reduces the signs of colitis [77]. Furthermore, AhR−/− mice are susceptible to infections with the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Citrobacter rodentium and with the fungus Candida albicans [76, 78, 79]. Protection against these pathogens is mediated by IL-22, which requires the AhR signaling [77, 80, 81].

# 6. Metabolite-Sensing G Protein-Coupled Receptors

Outside of the cells, metabolites can function as agonists for several metabolite-sensing GPCRs (Table 1). These receptors constitute the most abundant protein family of membrane proteins in mammals. Recently, multiple studies pointed out the importance of these receptors in maintaining physiological functions especially in the gut. When a ligand binds to metabolite-sensing GPCRs, it causes a conformational change. Thus, the receptors can activate an associated G protein. The G protein α subunit, can then dissociate from the β and γ subunits to further trigger intracellular signaling proteins or target functional proteins directly depending on the α subunit type (Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13) and β-arrestins, including cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), phospholipase c-β, and RhoGEFs.

Moreover, these receptors regulate downstream signaling pathways including, different kinase cascades, such as ERK/MAPK, JNK, p38, or the Akt/PI3K to control cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration [82–84]. We will further discuss the respective GPCRs identified over the past years and their signaling pathways in the context of IBD below.
