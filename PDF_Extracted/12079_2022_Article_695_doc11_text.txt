# Current Research on Anti-Inflammatory Compounds in Colorectal Cancer

such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17F. Y-27632 effectively repressed NFKB and STAT3 activation and prosurvival gene activity associated with these transcription factors. These outcomes indicated that Y-27632 inhibition of the NF-κB and IL-6/STAT3 pathways could ameliorate colonic inflammation and be an effective anti-inflammatory drug to treat UC and prevent CAC (Wang et al. 2020a, b).

Silibinin, an antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory used in a CAC mouse model to determine its impact on IL-6/IL-6R/STAT3 signaling, revealed that silibinin could reduce the size and amount of tumors in AOM/DSS mice. Moreover, scores of colitis and tumor were decreased. Silibinin also inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of tumor cells. Furthermore, the production of IL-6, as well as STAT3 phosphorylation, were remarkably repressed by silibinin (Zheng et al. 2018).

Oroxylin A, an O-methylated flavone, is another IL-6 inhibitor that can be used to treat CAC. A study on human HCT-116 cells treated with oroxylin A showed that this compound effectively repressed IL-6/IL-6R/STAT3 signaling. Additionally, during the experimental period, dietary administration of oroxylin A pointedly inhibited tumor cell proliferation, decreased the tumor burden, and induced apoptosis. On the other hand, the expression of IL-6 and IL-1β was down-regulated in isolated tumor tissues from mice treated with oroxylin A. Moreover, the IL-6/IL-6R/STAT3 signaling was reduced in the treated animals. Accordingly, oroxylin A may be a potential option for treating CAC via regulating IL-6/IL-6R/STAT3 signals in HCT-116 cells and AOM/DSS mice models (Yang et al. 2013).

Embelin, a small molecule that inhibits X-linked inhibitors of apoptosis protein (XIAP), can also have anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antioxidant properties. An investigation on CAC-bearing mice reported that embelin considerably reduced tumor size and incidence in the studied animals. Furthermore, embelin repressed the expression and release of colonic IL-6 and subsequently activated STAT3 in vivo. Notably, embelin reduced both the IL-6–induced and constitutive STAT3 activation in CRC cells via promoting Src homology domain 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) activity in vitro. Additionally, embelin down-regulated the expression of IL-1β, IL-17A, and IL-23, along with reducing the number of infiltrated macrophages and CD4 + T cells in the inflamed colonic tissues. Accordingly, these outcomes showed that embelin could suppress CAC tumorigenesis, and its antitumor impact is partly mediated via reducing Th17-mediated responses and the activation of IL-6/IL-6R/STAT3 signals and immune response (Dai et al. 2014).

Interestingly, cocoa as a compound enriched with polyphenols has anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antioxidant activities. A study reported that the cocoa diet significantly reduced CAC-induced mice's tumor size and incidence by inhibiting tumor epithelial cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Cocoa repressed colonic IL-6 expression and STAT3 activation (Saadatdoust et al. 2015).

Tea polysaccharides (TPS) isolated from tea leaves are the main nutraceutical component with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor activities. A study on AOM/DSS mouse model and IL-6-induced CT26 CRC line demonstrated that TPS considerably condensed tumor size and incidence and noticeably repressed the infiltration of pro-inflammatory immune cells and release of IL-6 matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), VEGF, cyclin Dl, and survivin in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, TPS can attenuate the CAC progression by suppressing the IL-6/IL-6R/STAT3 pathway and the expression of downstream genes (Liu et al. 2018).

Although the mentioned compounds have been studied in CAC, it appears that the involvement of colitis in the development of CRC and the effect of these compounds on the IL-6/IL-6R axis can be used in the treatment of IBD.

# Modifying the gut microbiome to reduce IL‑6‑mediated inflammation

The gut microbiome's content has been considered one of the main factors associated with inflammatory-based diseases, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic disorders (Tilg and Kaser 2011; Devaraj et al. 2013; Taneja 2014; Halfvarson et al. 2017). According to the cross-sectional studies, dysregulated immune responses to the gut microbiome could be involved in the pathogenesis of IBD because the microbiome pattern of patients with UC, CD and ileal CD is altered more than in healthy individuals (Halfvarson et al. 2017). Therefore, therapies aimed at changing the microbiome content can help treat inflammatory diseases such as IBD (Table 1).

# Herbal medicine and other natural compounds

An experimental study conducted a nutritional intervention using Moringa oleifera to modulate inflammation by affecting the number of caecal Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli in mice under a high-fat diet. Finding demonstrated that in mice with a high-fat diet, intestinal levels of Bifidobacteria significantly decreased while the number of Lactobacilli pointedly increased compared with normal control mice. Furthermore, serum levels of IL-6 and body weight increased in mice fed a high-fat diet. Interestingly, following treatment with Moringa oleifera, the number of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, as well as IL-6 levels and body weight, were meaningfully restored in the studied animals feeding a high-fat diet (Elabd et al. 2018).

Ginger also can affect the regulation of the gut microbiome (Wang et al. 2020a; b). In DDS-induced mice models of colitis administration, ginger improved colitis-associated.
