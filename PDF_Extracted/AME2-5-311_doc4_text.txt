# 4.1 Intestinal microbiota shifts as a consequence of IBD

Under normal physiological conditions, the intestinal microbial community plays an important role in maintaining gut homeostasis; nevertheless, this homeostasis can be altered by various stimulations, such as exogenous infections, antibiotic use, dietary antigens, and toxins. Indeed, altered composition and diversity of the microbiota have been documented in the intestine of IBD patients as compared with healthy individuals before or after treatment. IBD patients exhibited a reduction in α-diversity and abundance of Firmicutes compared to healthy individuals. Besides, elevation in gut Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes has been reported. Clinical observation revealed that IBD patients exhibited the decrease in overall diversity, reduced abundance of bacteria with anti-inflammatory property, such as Clostridium groups IV and XIVa, Bacteroides, Suterella, Roseburia, Bifidobacterium spp., and Feacalibacterium prausnitzii, as well as enhanced abundance of colitogenic microbiota, including adherent invasive E. coli, Pasteurellaceae, Veillonellaceae, Fusobacterium spp., and Ruminococcus gnavus. In particular, elevated abundance of Pasturellaceae, Veillonellaceae, Neisseriaceae, Fusobacteriaceae spp., and E. coli and reduced abundance of Bacteroides, Clostridiales, F. prausnitzii, Roseburia spp., Blautia spp., Helicobacter pylori, and Ruminococcus spp. were reported in CD patients (Table 2). UC patients exhibited a less species diversity at all stages of the disease in comparison with healthy individuals. It has been reported that an induction of E. coli and reduction of F. prausnitzii were also observed in UC patients, which is similar with CD patients. Besides, UC patients displayed even higher inflammation and dysbiosis compared to those with CD. Generally, later analysis showed that lower abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (B. pullicaecorum), Roseburia hominis (R. hominis), and Clostridium colinum (C. colinum) and higher abundance of Fusobacterium spp. were indicated in UC patients in comparison with healthy individuals (Table 2).

Treatment with DSS resulted in a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and a significant higher abundance of Proteobacteria. Furthermore, decreased abundance of Lactobacillus, Alloprevotella, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and increased abundance of Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Akkermansia, and Desulfovibrio were also found in DSS-treated mice (Table 2). Reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes and increased abundance of Proteobacteria were observed in TNBS-treated mice, which are further characterized by increased abundance of E. coli and decreased abundance of Lactobacillus johnsonii (L. johnsonii). In addition, reduced abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Methylobacteriaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, and Lachnospiraceae were reported in TNBS-treated mice (Table 2). In acetic acid–induced mouse model of colitis, reductions in Clostridia, Ruminococcaceae, and Clostridiales and inductions of Enterobacteria were reported (Table 2). Otherwise, little is known on the disrupted roles of acetic acid in colitis of mice. C. rodentium infection in mice resulted in decreased α-diversity of the microbiota and populations of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Clostridia, as well as increased populations of Fusobacterium and Enterococcus. Another study also observed reductions in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Alistipes, Turicibacter, Parabacteroides, and Alloprevotella, as well as inductions of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group in C. rodentium-infected mice (Table 2). Dysbiosis in IBD patients and chemical-induced colitis in mice have been well documented in numerous studies; however, changes in specific taxa may be inconsistent, which may be affected by various factors, including gender, age, diets, and reared environment. Knowing the role of dysbiosis in the development progress of IBD will help with clinical therapeutic options based on intestinal microbiota. They have also contributed to the development of novel therapeutic options that selectively target dysbiosis in IBD.
