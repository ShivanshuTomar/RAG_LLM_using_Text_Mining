CRH signaling plays a crucial role in the so-called “brain–gut interactions” in IBD. IBD patients with high psychosocial stress have enhanced intestinal autophagy. The potential relationship between autophagy and psychosocial stress was evaluated in IBD patients. Ten patients with mild/moderate IBD and 13 patients with severe IBD were recruited, and their basic characteristics, endoscopic images, and colonic tissue during the colonoscopy procedures were collected. The mean modified Mayo Score system in mild/moderate IBD and severe IBD were 7.6 and 11.3, respectively (P < 0.001). Comparison of the basic characteristics was performed between the patients in the two groups. No significant differences were found in the baseline characteristics, including sex, age, disease duration, smoking history, and medications. However, the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS) of the severe IBD patients was significantly higher than that of the mild/moderate IBD patients. A Spearman rank correlation analysis between CPSS and the Mayo score showed a positive relationship between the perceived stress and the severity of IBD in the patients.

To further explore the relationship between autophagy and IBD severity in IBD patients, we chose six IBD patients with the lowest CPSS and six IBD patients with the highest CPSS from the all 23 individuals. The endoscopic images, histology (H&E staining), monocytes/macrophages infiltration (CD68 immunohistochemistry), and autophagy (LC3 immunohistochemistry) were shown. Colonoscopy images and histologic detection confirmed the increase in inflammatory infiltration in the colon of patients with a higher CPSS compared to the patients with lower level of perceived stress. Intriguingly, the biopsy specimens from the patients with higher CPSS showed a marked increase in LC3 staining, which is a molecular marker of autophagy.

In addition, the protein levels of autophagy-related Beclin-1 and LC3-II/I ratio in intestinal biopsy specimens from patients with mild/moderate IBD were higher than those in health control individuals. In the intestinal biopsy specimens from severe IBD patients, the levels of Beclin-1 and LC3-II/I ratio were much higher. Positive correlations between the IBD score and the Beclin-1 or LC3-II/I ratio were found. Moreover, the psychosocial stress score was also positively correlated with the levels of Beclin-1 or LC3-II/I ratio. In addition, the protein levels of autophagy-related Atg16L1, Atg4B, and ATF4 in intestinal biopsy specimen from control, mild/moderate IBD patients and severe patients were analyzed. The protein expression of Atg16L1 and Atg4B increased in IBD patients. Moreover, they displayed much higher expression in severe IBD patients compared with mild/moderate IBD patients. ATF4 was not altered among these groups.
