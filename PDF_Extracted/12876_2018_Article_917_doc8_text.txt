# Downloading 1000IBD research data

The 1000IBD research data can be downloaded from the EGA at https://ega-archive.org using accession number EGAS00001002702. All raw files (FASTQ, IDAT) from genotyping and sequencing of the genome, transcriptome and microbiome will be available to run through custom pipelines. Researchers can reuse the 1000IBD data and perform analyses without the need to set up a cohort, collect samples or perform expensive sequencing. The sharing and reusing of the 1000IBD data will drive IBD research forwards.

# Recalling 1000IBD participants for additional sampling

1000IBD participants are recallable for additional sampling. The possibility to recall patients for additional material is only available to UMCG researchers. However, collaborations in which extra material is collected are possible.

# Coauthorship and citing 1000IBD

The arrangements for publication regarding co-authorship or just citation will depend on the extent of cooperation required by the Groningen team. If IBD participants need to be recalled for additional sampling or if large data processing efforts by the Groningen team are required, co-authorship will be required. However, if a limited amount of data is requested from the EGA, citation of the current manuscript would suffice.

# Privacy and controlled access

To share the molecular and clinical data in a responsible way, we need to maintain patient privacy. It is therefore not possible to publicly share extensive phenotype data, and the publicly available phenotype data will remain limited to a basic phenotype set. 1000IBD data is stored externally in the EGA, but because 1000IBD consists of patient data, a controlled access procedure is in place.

# Preparation of next release

While the first data is released, preparations for the second data release are on-going. The second 1000IBD data release will consist of: i. the complete 544 microbiome WGS metagenomes from stool samples from 544 1000IBD participants and ii. pooled targeted resequencing of UC susceptibility loci.

# Conclusions

The 1000IBD project aims to discover molecular subtypes of IBD and biomarker profiles that capture the clinical heterogeneity of IBD and to prioritise new targets for early stage drug discovery or other interventional strategies by generating extensive multi-omics and phenotype data of over 1000 IBD patients. The project is a showcase for FAIR data management following the guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship (FAIR: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) [39, 40]. All 1000IBD data that can be shared without violating patient privacy will be made available to the scientific community.
