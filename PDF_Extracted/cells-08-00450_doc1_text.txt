# 2. Diet as A Risk Factor for IBD: Epidemiological Studies

The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs). Besides microbial products, other factors, including bacterial metabolites, can influence the immune response to commensals or pathogens. In this system, microbiota-derived metabolites serve as “signal molecules” and continuously contribute to the proper function of the gut by acting on the epithelium and immune cells. It has been estimated that 10% of metabolites, found in the mammalian blood stem from the gut microbiota [8], and these compounds, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) primarily acetate, propionate and butyrate, indole and polyamines [9–11], are present in most host tissue [12].

The mechanisms that are influenced by dietary and bacterial metabolites are embedded in a complex signaling network. Host enzymes have the ability to directly digest some dietary products like the milk sugar lactose, which is digested into glucose and galactose by lactase. On the other hand, breakdown of certain molecules requires the involvement of microbiota. Dietary and host products are fermented by bacteria in the gut that produce metabolites, which in turn influences host immune responses. Moreover, an immune reaction against a pathogen will change the metabolism of the organism, as highlighted by a reduced immune response that is a evolutionarily conserved response to infections in warm- and cold-blooded organisms.

Microbial- or host-derived metabolites may act intracellularly either as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, allowing the transcription of genes or as transcriptional coactivators (Figure 1). On the other hand, these metabolites may also act as extracellular signaling molecules through the metabolite sensing-G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [9]. In this review, we focus on metabolite-sensing GPCRs and their ligands, which contribute to: (i) The regulation of intestinal immune system through inflammatory leukocytes, regulatory T (Tregs) cells, and (ii) the control of the intestinal barrier between gut microbes and host (action on nonimmune cells) [13]. Traditionally, GPCRs are receptors for hormones, neurotransmitters, and chemokines. However, this view is now changing as a growing number of metabolite-sensing GPCRs are being identified as receptors for metabolites, including fatty acid family members, which vary in carbon chain length, ranging from short chain fatty acids SCFAs (C2-5), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) (C6-12), and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) (> C13); products of tryptophan metabolism and various others [9,10].

In this review, we first summarize the biology of the metabolite-sensing GPCRs. Second, we discuss recent findings demonstrating the impact of the receptor signaling and their metabolite ligands on IBD in order to explain, in part, the role of diet and metabolite-mediated inflammatory processes, and finally to provide new therapeutic strategies for the treatment or the prevention of IBD.

The incidence of IBD is rising in industrialized countries [3,14]. Westernization of lifestyle is associated with changes in diet, hygiene status, antibiotic use, microbial exposure, and pollution. These factors have been associated with the development of IBD [15]. However, diet is one of the potential environmental factors that may link industrialization and the western lifestyle to the increased incidence of IBD [16]. Numerous large prospective cohort studies have attempted to identify dietary patterns that contribute to the risk for IBD. The Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) showed that people who consume a high amount of fiber, mainly fruits, are less susceptible to developing CD [7]. Findings from these cohorts showed an inverse correlation between the risk of CD and the intake of potassium and zinc [17,18].

Furthermore, the NHS showed that higher consumption of high omega-3 (n-3) to omega-6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio is protective against the development of UC [5]. Similarly, the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Study showed that individuals who consume high amounts of red meat, which contains a high concentration of linoleic acid (an n-6 PUFA), have a higher incidence of UC [19].
