differed significantly between dysbiotic IBD and healthy pediatric microbiomes (p value < 0.05, Additional file 1: Table S7). Strain contributions mostly depleted in the IBD microbiomes included those of Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC 8482, Ruminococcus (Blautia) torques L2-14, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii strains, Eubacterium rectale strains, Ruminococcus sp. SR1-5, and Clostridium sp. M62-1 (p values for strains were < 0.001, Additional file 1: Table S7). The IBD microbiomes had significantly lower deconjugated CA and CDCA contributions by Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes representatives (p values < 0.05, Additional file 1: Table S7 and Additional file 2: Figure S7). The contribution of 12-dehydro-CA production flux, which was significantly reduced in the IBD microbiomes (p value < 0.001, Additional file 1: Table S7) was attributed mostly to representatives of the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families, which are considered to be beneficial due to containing many butyrate producers [41]. These representatives included two Faecalibacterium prausnitzii strains (p value < 0.001), a species well known to be depleted in IBD [42]. In contrast, the overall 7-dehydro-CA production potential was comparable between the IBD and the healthy pediatric microbiomes (Additional file 1: Table S7). However, the strains contributing were different, with reduced contributions by commensal bacteria to the production of 7-keto-DCA/7-dehydro-CDCA, and increased contributions of the pathogenic Escherichia coli strains O157-H7 Sakai and UTI89 UPEC (Additional file 1: Table S7). These two strains contributed significantly higher to deconjugation and 7-keto-DCA/7-dehydro-CDCA production in the IBD microbiomes (p value < 0.001, Additional file 1: Table S7). Taken together, the dysbiotic IBD microbiomes, compared to the healthy control microbiomes, were depleted in contributions of a variety of commensal microbes to bile salt hydrolase and to bile acid biotransformation but enriched in contributions of pathogenic Escherichia sp. (Additional file 1: Table S7). Thus, the IBD microbiomes had distinct bile acid deconjugation and transformation potential, consistent with reports that bile acid composition in IBD patients is abnormal [5]. In total, 488 analyzed features, which encompasses total production, strain contributions, and reaction abundances, were significantly different (p-value <0.05), of which 375 were highly significant (p-value <0.001) (Additional file 1: Table S7).

# Shadow price analysis identifies individual-specific bottlenecks in bile acid biotransformation potential.

To test whether the bile acid production potential could be directly predicted from the abundance of the metagenomics data mapped onto the AGORA reconstruction (i.e., from the encoding gene abundance), we calculated the Spearman correlation between the individual production potential for the two deconjugated primary and 13 secondary bile acids (Table 1) and the total community abundance for all reactions in the bile acid pathway in the 194 community models. Consistently, for 13 of the 15 bile acids, the correlation between production potential and the abundance of reaction directly synthesizing the respective bile acid was 0.96 or higher (Additional file 1: Table S9). The secondary bile acid Iso-CA is synthesized from 3-dehydro-CA by 3β-HSDH. Surprisingly, the Spearman correlation between production potential for Iso-CA/Iso-CDCA and the abundance of the 3β-HSDH reaction (VMH ID: ICA3bHSDHe/ICDCA3bHSDHe) calculated for all 194 microbiome models was only 0.18 indicating that the reaction abundance of the producing reaction did not correlate with production (Additional file 1: Table S9). In fact, only a minority of the 194 microbiome models with a high abundance of the 3β-HSDH reaction (VMH ID: ICA3bHSDHe), all of which were IBD microbiomes, also had a high Iso-CA production flux (Fig. 4a). Thus, factors other than 3β-HSDH abundance limited the production flux. To identify these factors, the metabolic fluxes needed to be analyzed in the context of the pathway and the microbial community. Constraint-based modeling is ideal for such analyses of metabolic dependencies since it is mechanistic on the molecule level and takes species-species metabolic exchanges and boundaries into account [18].

To identify the factors limiting the production potential for secondary bile acids, the shadow prices associated with the flux solutions of each microbiome model were analyzed. Shadow prices are a standard feature of constraint-based modeling that are routinely calculated with each feasible flux balance analysis solution. Briefly, the shadow price is a measurement for the value of a metabolite towards the optimized objective function, which indicates whether the flux through the objective function would increase or decrease when the availability of this metabolite would increase by one unit [7]. A positive or negative shadow price indicates that increased availability of the metabolite would either increase or decrease the flux through the objective function (note that this definition varies by solver), respectively. In contrast, the availability of a metabolite with a shadow price of zero has no influence on the flux through the objective function. To identify limiting factors for secondary bile acid production, we investigated the shadow prices in the flux balance analysis solutions (see the “Materials and methods” section) when optimizing the production of the secondary bile acids in the 194 microbiome models (Fig. 4b, Additional file 1: Table S10). Nonzero shadow prices with an absolute value higher than 10−6 indicating importance for bile acid production flux were found for biomass metabolites of 129 strains carrying bile acid enzymes, for strain-specific metabolites in the bile acid pathway, and
