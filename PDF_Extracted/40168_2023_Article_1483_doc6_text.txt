(Table 2; scaffolds 1 and 3). The highest region of variability is the 3′ region of the sag gene, whereas different exogeneous MMTV strains demonstrate limited variability as compared to other retroviruses, such as HIV, due to the high fidelity of the MMTV Pol protein that minimizes error during the reverse transcription process [29].

Active MMTV infection in mice can be demonstrated by evaluating superantigen activity and observing differences in the cognate TCR-Vβ subsets that react with the specific vSAG [14]. The IL-10−/− model has a mixed genetic background of several mouse strains including the C57BL/6 and substrains of 129, each with different and partially characterized endogenous mtv loci [30]. For example, the C57BL/6 mouse has three full-length endogenous genomes, mtv-8, mtv-9, and mtv-17, and substrains of 129 mice contain combinations of mtv-1, mtv-3, mtv-8, mtv-9, mtv-11, mtv-13, and mtv-17 [14–16]. As variable sag sequences were observed in the IL-10−/− mouse milk (Table 2), we cloned and sequenced MMTV sag directly from spleen RNA to determine the predominant vSAG triggering changes in TCR-Vβ subsets. Eleven of 12 clones were derived from mtv-9 sag encoding the vSAG9 (Fig. 2A) that preferentially binds and expands TCR-Vβ5, TCR-Vβ11, and TCR-Vβ12 lymphocytes [14]. We then evaluated the TCR-Vβ subset distribution in the spleen and colon (Supplemental Fig. 2) and found that TCR-Vβ5 and TCR-Vβ12 were expressed in sufficient quantity for analysis, but TCR-Vβ11 constituted less than 0.5% of the population. Significant differences were observed in the colon that were not observed in the spleen (Supplemental Fig. 2). Consistent with vSAG9-induced activity, the percentage of TCR-Vβ12 was significantly increased (17.14 vs. 6.45, q = 0.012), and a trend was observed for increased TCR-Vβ5 (IL-10−/− vs. SvEv, 0.63% vs. 0.21%, q = 0.067) in the IL-10−/− versus the SvEv WT colon (Fig. 2B).

# Combination ART reduces the severity of colitis in IL‑10−/−

To address the hypothesis that MMTV plays a role in the development of inflammation in the IL-10−/− mouse model, we employed a cART regimen previously shown to ameliorate MMTV cholangitis in the NOD.c3c4 autoimmune biliary disease model of primary biliary cholangitis [21]. The cART was composed of combination nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a boosted protease inhibitor added to the drinking water of IL-10−/− and SvEv WT mice (Fig. 3A). The cART and placebo were commenced at 4 weeks of age, and following this, mice were assessed for body weight every 2 weeks. The cART treatment did not alter growth in either WT or IL-10−/− mice (Fig. 3B). The weight gain over time was reduced in the IL-10−/− pups (n = 10) versus WT (n = 4) receiving cART and similarly in the IL-10−/− (n = 9) versus WT (n = 4) receiving placebo (p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). As both WT and IL-10−/− had a similar amount of food and drink and the drop-off in weight corresponds with the development of colitis, we attribute the weight changes to catabolism from the inflammatory bowel disease.

As anticipated, IL-10−/− mice had greater histological damage in the colon as compared to the SvEv WT animals (p < 0.001, Fig. 4A and B). The cART was associated with reduced histological scores in the IL-10−/− mice as compared to those on placebo (p < 0.01), which was associated with a significant reduction in MMTV viral load (Fig. 4C), whereas WT treated with cART had minimal change versus placebo in histology or MMTV RNA expression, which likely reflected endogenous retrovirus expression that would not be responsive to antiviral therapy (Fig. 4B and C). Colon weight-to-length ratio was significantly increased in IL-10−/− mice compared to SvEv WT (p < 0.002). Also, the colon weight-to-length ratio in IL-10−/− mice on cART showed a trend for reduction compared to IL-10−/− on placebo (Fig. 4D).

To evaluate the role of viral infection in generating colitis in the IL-10−/− mouse model, we measured the levels of MMTV RNA in the colon using QuantiGene hybridization technology rather than RT-qPCR because of the improved accuracy of the former with lower levels of MMTV RNA [24]. Of note, these levels represent both the presence of exogenous MMTV viral RNA as well as the expression of endogenous viral mRNA. A cutoff was established using background levels MMTV RNA in SvEv WT colon samples (Fig. 4D), and as a result, all the WT mice were found to have colon MMTV RNA levels below this level as compared to 25% of the IL-10−/− (Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.0001). Little difference was observed in the WT mouse colon MMTV RNA levels with cART, whereas the mean levels were reduced 25% in IL-10−/− mice receiving cART vs placebo (Fig. 4D). Following cART, 42% of IL-10−/− colon samples were found to have background levels of MMTV RNA as compared to 10% of the mice on placebo (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.028). Also, a trend was observed for a correlation of viral load and histology score (Spearman r 0.32, p = 0.082, Supplementary Fig. 3).

To gain a more in-depth understanding of the effects of cART on inflammation in the IL-10−/− mouse model, we examined the presence of a series of IBD-associated cytokines in colonic tissues. As expected, the levels of the pro-inflammatory markers, TNF-α, KC GRO, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-12p70, IL-4, and IL-5, were generally elevated in IL-10−/− mice compared to SvEv WT (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 4). At the end of the study, the IL-10−/− mice on cART experienced a significant reduction in the
