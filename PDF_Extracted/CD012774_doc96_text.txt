# Inclusion criteria

- CD or IBD-Unclassified favoring CD (as deemed by the participant's primary pediatric gastroenterologist)
- Active symptoms

# Exclusion criteria

- Severe comorbid medical illness (at discretion of participant's primary pediatric gastroenterologist)
- Concomitant Clostridioides difficile infection
- Severe CD flare requiring hospitalization
- Commenced new or temporary medical therapies (i.e. corticosteroids, antibiotics, prebiotics) within 4 weeks prior to trial; note: weaning doses of corticosteroid will be permitted (≤ 0.25 mg/kg/day)
- Current enrollment in another clinical trial
- Inability to give informed consent or assent

# Interventions

# Experimental arm

- Baseline FMT colonoscopic infusion at week 0, followed by twice-weekly oral microbiota capsule therapy for 6 weeks (including week 0)

# Control arm

- Baseline normal saline colonoscopic infusion at week 0, followed by twice-weekly dextrose-containing oral placebo capsule therapy for 6 weeks (including week 0)

# Outcomes

# Primary outcomes

- Monthly recruitment rate at week 30: assessment of recruitment rate (based on participants meeting all eligibility criteria who were approached for trial entry)
- Dropout rate after enrollment at week 30: rate of participants leaving the trial (participant- or protocol-directed exclusion) after enrollment
- Rate of participant protocol adherence at week 30: rate of participants providing all required blood, stool, and urine samples per protocol
- Rate of adverse events at week 30: rate of participants requiring hospitalization, or experiencing PCDAI increase ≥ 20 at 2 successive measures

# Secondary outcomes

- Clinical: improvement in disease symptoms at baseline, and weeks 6 and 30: PCDAI decrease ≥ 15 from baseline: weeks 6 and 30
- Clinical: remission in disease symptoms at weeks 6 and 30: PCDAI ≤ 10: weeks 6 and 30
- Clinical: improvement in serum inflammatory markers at baseline, and weeks 6 and 30: decrease CRP from baseline: weeks 6 and 30
- Clinical: improvement in mucosal inflammatory markers at baseline, and weeks 6 and 30: decrease fecal calprotectin from baseline: weeks 6 and 30
- Clinical: change in urine metabolomics at baseline, and weeks 6 and 30: change in urine metabolite profile from baseline: weeks 6 and 30
- Clinical: change in fecal microbiome at baseline, and weeks 6 and 30: change in fecal 16s rRNA + metagenomics profile from baseline: weeks 6 and 30
