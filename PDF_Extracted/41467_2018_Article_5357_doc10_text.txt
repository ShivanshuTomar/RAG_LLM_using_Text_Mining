In addition, we found that the expression level of proteins related to transposase and prophage, namely mobilome, was increased in the microbiome of IBD patients compared to controls. The mobilome has been shown as a key factor in affecting the microbiome dynamics or adaptation in response to intestinal environmental changes47 and Diard et al. reported that the presence of inflammation and oxidative stress in the intestine can promote the induction of prophage lysogenic conversion48.

Accordingly, we found a significant increase of proteins uniquely belonging to Caudovirales phages (Fig. 5c), in IBD compared to control, which is also in agreement with a previous virome metagenomics study8. In Prokaryotes, the CRISPR/Cas system acts as an important immune system against foreign nucleic acids, such as phage genome sequences21,22. Interestingly, we identified two CRISPR/Cas system related functions that were significantly increased in both CD and UC (Fig. 3a), further providing evidence for the bloom of bacteriophage in the microbiome of IBD patients. Given that these mobile gene elements (MGEs) are usually associated with the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of antibiotic resistance determinants49,50, the findings in the current study may also suggest an increased susceptibility to antibiotic resistance of gut microbiota in patients with IBD.

We previously demonstrated by 16s rRNA gene sequencing an increase of H2S producers and decrease of butyrate-producers in pediatric IBD, which was associated with the down-regulation of mitochondrial H2S detoxifying proteins9. Here, we further revealed that microbial proteins with functions of L-cysteine desulfidase and dissimilatory sulfite reductase, two important pathways for H2S production, were increased in the MLI microbiome from pediatric IBD patients. In addition to H2S production, we found a significant increase of L-cysteine degradation (including the enzymes for H2S production) and decrease of L-cysteine biosynthesis in the intestinal microbiome of IBD patients. L-cysteine plays a vital role in regulating cellular redox potential through the synthesis of anti-oxidant glutathione (GSH)51. L-cysteine has also been shown to play important roles in maintaining the gut barrier functions25,52. Although it’s still unknown whether the alteration of L-cysteine metabolism is a cause or consequence of the elevated oxidative stress, our findings suggest that the dysregulated gut microbial L-cysteine utilization together with the elevated intestinal oxidative stressors may influence the development of mucosal inflammation in IBD.

In summary, we performed a large-scale gut metaproteomic study of a pediatric IBD inception cohort to assess both the intestinal microbiome and its associated human proteins. We characterized the functional activity of the MLI microbiota at the early stage of IBD and identified new host-microbiome signatures of pediatric IBD at the MLI, including the alterations of microbial mobilome and L-cysteine metabolism, both of which are indicative of elevated oxidative stress. In addition, we performed the first proteomic characterization of intestinal EVs from children with new-onset IBD and demonstrated that the host defense proteins present in the isolated EV samples, in particular the reactive oxidant-producing enzymes, may contribute to the increased oxidative stress in the intestine. The latter may lead to microbial defense responses and functional adaptations, which may initiate the gut microbial dysbiosis and in turn contribute to the development of mucosal inflammation. This study thereby provides valuable protein-level information for aiding in understanding the host–microbiome interactions underlying the development of IBD.

# Methods

# Subjects and MLI aspirate sample collections

Seventy-one pediatric patients (&lt;18 years old) were included in this study. All eligible patients were undergoing clinically indicated endoscopic examination following their consultation to General Gastroenterology clinic for suspected IBD. None of the participants had ever been on any empiric IBD treatments. The most common reasons for colonoscopy were non-acute abdominal pain, reports of rectal bleeding, non-acute diarrhea and weight loss. Non-IBD controls had visually normal mucosa, histologically normal mucosal biopsies and normal imaging to definitively rule out IBD. The diagnosis of IBD was performed according to standard criteria following thorough clinical, endoscopic, histologic and radiological evaluation53. In total, 25 patients were diagnosed with CD, 22 patients were diagnosed with UC, and 24 patients were deemed non-IBD controls. The study and clinical sample collection protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), Ottawa, ON, Canada. All patients were newly diagnosed and naïve to treatment. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The following exclusion criteria were implemented: (1) presence of diabetes mellitus; (2) presence of infectious gastroenteritis within 2 months; (3) use of any antibiotics or probiotics within 4 weeks, or (4) irritable bowel syndrome. Clinical disease activity of CD was determined using the PCDAI (Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index)54 and of UC using the PUCAI (Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index)55.

Intestinal MLI aspirate samples were collected from the DeC, AsC and/or TI during diagnostic colonoscopy for each participant. During colonoscopy, any loose fluid and debris was first aspirated and discarded. Thereafter, sterile water was flushed onto the mucosa to dislodge the mucus layer from the mucosal epithelial cells and the resulting mixture was aspirated into a container, which was immediately put on ice and transferred to the laboratory for processing.

# MLI aspirate sample processing for metaproteomic analysis

Aspirate samples were first centrifuged at 700 g, 4 °C for 5 min and the supernatant was transferred into a new tube for another centrifugation at 14,000 g, 4 °C for 20 min. This pellet fraction was then harvested for metaproteomics analysis. Protein extraction and trypsin digestion were performed according to our previously published procedure15. Briefly, proteins were extracted with protein lysis buffer containing 4 % (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 6 M urea in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The protein lysates were then subjected to three ultrasonications (30 s each with 1 min interval on ice) using a Q125 Sonicator (Qsonica, LLC) with an amplitude of 25%. Remaining cell debris was removed through high-speed centrifugation at 16,000 g, 4 °C for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was then precipitated using 5-fold volume acidified acetone/ethanol buffer at −20 °C overnight. Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, and washed with ice-cold acetone three times. The protein pellets were then re-suspended in 6 M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. For in-solution trypsin digestion, 50 μg of proteins for each sample were reduced and alkylated with 10 mM dithiothreitol and 20 mM iodoacetamide, respectively. One microgram of trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) was then added for digestion at 37 °C overnight with agitation. The tryptic peptides were desalted with a 10-μm C18 column and the tryptic peptides were analyzed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc.). Briefly, peptides equivalent to 2 μg proteins were loaded and separated on an analytical column (75 μm × 50 cm) packed with reverse phase beads (1.9 μm; 120-Å pore size; Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) with 4 h gradient from 5 to 35% acetonitrile (v/v) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The instrument method consisted of one full MS scan from 300 to 1800 m/z followed by data-dependent MS/MS scan of the 12 most intense ions, a dynamic exclusion repeat count of 2, and repeat exclusion duration of 30 s. The MS data were exported as .RAW format, which were then processed with MetaPro-IQ bioinformatics workflow for peptide/protein identification and quantification15.

To ensure better coverage of the reference protein database, we generated an integrated human gut microbiome protein database, containing the proteins from (1) integrated gene catalog database (IGC) of human gut microbiome (containing 9,879,896 proteins)56; (2) NCBI reference sequence database of Virus (containing 275,423 proteins; downloaded at October 17, 2016 from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/); (3) 121,347 fungal protein sequences of 7 species that have been previously reported to present in pediatric IBD patients26,57, namely the proteomes of Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Clavispora lusitaniae, Cyberlindnera jadinii, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (the proteome databases were downloaded at November 24, 2016 from http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/); (4) an in-house MLI gut microbial gene catalog database (containing 1,088,113 predicted gene sequences), generated from shotgun metagenomics sequencing for 28 MLI samples of a pediatric IBD sub-cohort (12 control, 7 CD and 9 UC) and with an approach described previously15. The two gene catalog databases were combined and the redundant sequences were removed using CD-HIT (-c 0.95 -M 0 -G 0 -aS 0.9 -g 1 -d 0 -T 0)58. Among the 1,088,113 predicted MLI genes, 75,425 genes (6.9%) were absent in the IGC database which therefore provides additional sequence information for microbial protein and peptide identification from MS data.

We used an iterative database search strategy, namely MetaPro-IQ, that has been implemented as an integrated analysis platform (MetaLab)15,59, to increase the sensitivity of the large database search. Iterative database search strategies have previously been shown to improve the sensitivity of peptide identification using large databases and enable comparable performance to a matched metagenome database search strategy15,60. Briefly, each of the raw files was searched against the above generated integrated microbiome protein database. All matched protein sequences were extracted from each run and combined to generate a refined and
