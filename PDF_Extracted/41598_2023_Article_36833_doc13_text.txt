# Discussion

In this study, shared specific genes between IBD and RA were identified via bioinformatic analysis. These genes are associated with the gut microbiome in RA. CXCL10 was the most relevant gene associated with IBD and RA, which also had a direct relationship with metabolites produced by gut microbes in RA. Additionally, metabolites associated with the gut microbiome in RA and pathways associated with RA and IBD were identified. feron-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), is an ELR-CXC chemokine 54 . It is mostly induced in humans when cell-mediated immune responses are elicited in pathological conditions such as infection, allograft rejection, and autoimmunity 55 . The expression of CXCL10 is very low in the colonic epithelium but substantially increases in colitis under the induction of IFN-γ56,57 . Inhibiting CXCL10 reduces the frequency and severity of colitis and intestinal inflammation 58,59 . Additionally, patients with RA have higher CXCL10 expression in the synovial membrane 60 . High expression of CXCL10 mRNA and tissue infiltration of functional proteins in synovial tissue were also reported in CIA model rats with RA in a study on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell therapy 61. Increased CXCL10 mRNA has been observed in liver tissues of patients with HIV and HBV infection in various studies of inflammatory diseases, and its elevation is associated with disease activity62.
