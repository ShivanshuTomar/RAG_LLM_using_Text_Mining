Follow-up: 48–56 weeks

Follow-up: mean 56 weeks

*The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).

# Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

CI: confidence interval; FMT: fecal microbiota transplantation; IBDQ: Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire; MD: mean difference; RCT: randomized controlled trial; RR: risk ratio; UC: ulcerative colitis.

# GRADE Working Group grades of evidence

- High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
- Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
- Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
- Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
