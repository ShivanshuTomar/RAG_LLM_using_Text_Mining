# Microbiota in IBD

Many previous studies have shown environmental factors, such as modern lifestyle, diet, and antibiotic use, are associated with the development of IBD [5, 22–25]. Particularly, microbiota plays critical roles in pathogenesis of IBD together with genetic background and immunological factors. Utilizing the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, recent studies have profiled gut microbiota at high resolution and indicated reduced diversity of the gut microbiota in IBD patients [26–30]. For example, Frank et al. [31] demonstrated that the abundances of bacterial members of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are reduced and those of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria are increased in IBD. In addition, Sokol et al. [32, 33] demonstrated that the phylum Firmicutes, and particularly a member of Clostridium cluster IV, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, is reduced in the feces of Crohn’s disease patients. Consistently, later landmark studies have revealed 17 strains within clusters IV, XIVa, and XVIII of Clostridia induces regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the gut [34, 35].

Contrary to the immunosuppressive roles of specific bacteria, no specific bacteria has not been proved to do harm with IBD patients. For example, Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis has long been suspected to have a pathogenic effect on Crohn’s disease in a manner analogous to granuloma-forming mycobacterium infectious diseases [36]. However, an antitubercular drug administered to Crohn’s disease patients revealed no efficacy in a 2-year clinical trial [37]. Then, the relationship between other bacterial genera, such as Listeria and Mycoplasma, and Crohn’s disease has been investigated [38, 39]. However, recent studies have revealed possible interaction of “pathogenic” bacteria and breaking down intestinal homeostasis. Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) has been isolated from ileal biopsy samples from patients with Crohn’s disease. AIEC can be pathogenic by adhering and invading intestinal epithelial cells [40, 41]. AIEC also can replicate in macrophages and stimulate production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a by macrophages [41]. Fusobacterium varium has been known to attach to inflamed mucosa and invade ulcerated mucosa in ulcerative colitis patients [42]. Besides focusing on these specific microorganisms, alteration in the composition of gut microbiota has been also highlighted regarding with the pathogenesis of IBD or predication of disease course. F. prausnitzii is associated with the increased risk of post-operative recurrence in CD patients [33]. We recently demonstrated that 5-ASA intolerance is associated with a risk of adverse clinical outcomes and dysbiosis [43]. It is of note that computational analyses of gut microbiome allow to predict the efficacy of a certain biologic agent on UC [44].

In summary, the gut homeostasis is maintained by the balanced diverse microbiota and the possible “good” bacteria including members of clostridia, while some specific bacteria might be associated with developing IBD. However, it remains controversial whether the IBD-associated dysbiosis in the gut microbiota is a cause or a consequence of intestinal inflammation.

# Prebiotics

Dietary fibers, unlike starches, are carbohydrates with complex sugar chain structures. In recent years, the importance of dietary fiber has been noted, but humans themselves do not possess digestive enzymes that process dietary fibers. Dietary fiber can be digested in the body by probiotics that carry digestive enzymes, and individual dietary fiber molecules are collectively called prebiotics. Thus, prebiotics are important nutrient sources for probiotics growth. Probiotics not only proliferate using prebiotics as a nutrient source, but also produce beneficial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)—propionate, acetate, butylate—that play an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the host while metabolizing prebiotics [45]. In modern society, where the intake of dietary fibers is insufficient, treatment with supplementing prebiotics is a strategy to increase probiotics, and many attempts have been made for various diseases [46–50]. At present, although there is a large amount of evidence in animal models [51–55], clinical trials have been unsatisfactory. It is possible that in these studies, the doses were too small, the dosing period was too short, or the scale of the clinical trial was too small. Healthy individuals are exposed to health information now more than ever, such as the negative effects of a diet lacking in vegetables. However, some of this information, such as fashionable promotion of organic vegetables, is not fully supported by current scientific studies.

# Probiotics

Probiotics produce metabolites that are crucial for gut homeostasis. Examples of probiotic foods include yogurt, kimchi, and cheeses. With the recent boom in health information, some people have increased their intake, but this intake is likely much smaller than that of 100 years ago. We speculate that the emergence of the refrigerator—the “great invention” that changed the modern lifestyle—is critically involved in the dysbiosis in Western people. Until the eighteenth century, human beings consumed a large amount of fermented food, because fermenting was one of the major ways to preserve food, similar to salting, spicing, and smoking. Therefore, the ancient human was constantly exposed to fermenting bacteria by ingesting fermented food. However, the invention of the refrigerator enabled humans to preserve food easily, and the time-consuming process of fermented food was less common than it was in the “pre-refrigeration era.” At present, as with prebiotics, there is a
