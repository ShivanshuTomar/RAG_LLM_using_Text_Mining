# Machine learning technologies have been widely applied in the study of inflammatory diseases in recent years.

Using machine learning and deep learning, Maria Giovanna Danieli et al. investigated how intravenous and subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment affects patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies19. Isabelle Ayoub et al. used machine learning to assess the treatment response for lupus nephritis using standard clinical data with novel biomarkers20.

In this study, bioinformatic tools were used to identify the common specific genes and processes between RA and IBD and examine the relationship between the gut microbiome in RA and the shared specific genes. We comprehensively analyzed four gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE55235, GSE55457, GSE179285, and GSE77298) and an RA-related metagenomic sequencing dataset, PRJEB6997, from the GMrepo database. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify candidate genes associated with RA and IBD. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to assess changes at the pathway level. The shared specific genes between RA and IBD were screened using two types of machine learning algorithms and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The characteristics of the gut microbiome in RA were examined using differential analysis, two types of machine learning algorithms, and ROC curves. Subsequently, the shared specific genes related to the gut microbiome in RA were identified, and an interaction network of these genes and those related to shared GSEA pathways were constructed using the gutMGene, STITCH, and STRING databases. The Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine the connection between these genes and immune cells. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the common genes associated with both RA and IBD and their relationship with the gut microbiome in RA using a systematic bioinformatic approach. Figure 1 demonstrates the study design.

# Search strategy for datasets.

For RA, 127 datasets were systematically retrieved from the GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) using the keywords: ((((rheumatoid arthritis[MeSH Terms]) OR rheumatoid arthritis) AND human[Organism]) AND Expression profiling by array[Filter]) AND (“2012/01/01” [Publication Date]: “2022/01/01” [Publication Date]). Exclusion criteria: (1) Excluded those with a small sample size (sample size < 20), (2) Excluded datasets that were irrelevant (it is not rheumatoid arthritis), (3) Excluded blood samples and/or cell samples, (4) Excluded samples with significant drug, vaccine, age, environmental, psychological, regional genetic, or epidemiological factors, and (5) Excluded samples lacking normal samples (listed in Fig. 1).

For IBD, 112 datasets were systematically retrieved from the GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) using the keywords: ((((inflammatory bowel disease[MeSH Terms]) OR inflammatory bowel disease) AND human[Organism]) AND Expression profiling by array[Filter]) AND (“2012/01/01” [Publication Date]: “2022/01/01” [Publication Date]). Exclusion criteria: (1) Excluded those with a small sample size (sample size < 50), (2) Excluded datasets that were irrelevant (it is not inflammatory bowel disease), (3) Excluded impure mRNA or non-mRNA transcriptome datasets, (4) Excluded samples with significant drug, age, environmental, psychological, regional genetic, or epidemiological factors, (5) Excluded blood samples and/or cell samples, (6) Excluded samples lacking normal samples, (7) Excluded single disease datasets, and (8) Excluded datasets with ambiguous disease sample site types. Inclusion criteria (Novelty assessment): The one with the most recent publication date and the fewest studies on PubMed was selected based on the exclusion criteria (listed in Fig. 1).

For the intestinal flora of RA, three datasets were systematically retrieved from the GMrepo database21 (https://gmrepo.humangut.info/home) using the keywords: [Arthritis, Rheumatoid]. Exclusion criteria: (1) Excluded datasets with 16 s rDNA, (2) Excluded datasets without publications in NCBI BioProjects (listed in Fig. 1).

# Extraction and preprocessing of GEO data.

The microarray datasets GSE5523522, GSE5545722, GSE17928523, and GSE7729824 were analyzed. Additionally, Homo sapiens samples for the GSE55235 and GSE55457 datasets using the R package GEOquery were extracted from the GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) were generated using the GPL96 [HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array platform; those for the GSE179285 dataset were generated using the Agilent 014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4 × 44 K G4112F (Probe Name version) platform; and those for the GSE77298 dataset were generated using the GPL570 [HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform. The GSE55235 dataset contained 10 synovial tissue samples from patients with RA and 10 samples from healthy individuals; the GSE55457 dataset contained 10 synovial tissue samples from healthy individuals and 13 samples from patients with RA; the GSE179285 dataset contained 14 inflamed colon tissue samples from patients with CD, 23 inflamed colon tissue samples from patients with UC, and 23 healthy colon tissue samples from healthy individuals; the GSE77298 dataset contained 16 synovial tissue samples from patients with RA and 7 samples from healthy individuals. The data from the GSE55235, GSE55457, and GSE77298 datasets were normalized using the RMA algorithm in the Affy package26 in R. The training set was created by merging the data from the GSE55235 and GSE55457 datasets, and the validation set was created using the data from the GSE77298 dataset. Additionally, the batch effects of the combined GSE55235 and GSE55457 datasets were removed using the Combat function of the sva package28. The principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the batch effect correction of the combined data29. Data from the GSE179285 dataset were downloaded, standardized, and analyzed using GEOquery25, Biobase and limma packages30. We used a distinct function of the “dplyr” package to remove the duplicate genes from each dataset31. R software (version 4.3.0) was used for all data processing and analysis. Table 1 shows the comprehensive information for each dataset.
