A SARS-CoV-2 infection via nasal passage infecting lungs and the virus multiplies in the alveolar cells, disrupt the immune system. The virus travels to the gut via mucosal lung-gut axis to create dysbiosis.

B Schematic representation of gut microbiota dysbiosis and the establishment of flow of microflora through lung-gut axis to exacerbate the infection.
