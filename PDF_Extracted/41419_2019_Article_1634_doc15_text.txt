# Microbial and imputed metagenomic analysis

The 16S rRNA sequencing data were processed by the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology platform (V.1.9.1) and MegaBLAST search was conducted to align the reads of the Operational taxonomic units against the reference sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information 16S rRNA database as described previously69. For metagenomic analysis, the metagenomes of gut microbiome were imputed from 16S rRNA sequences with PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States). The gene contents were predicted for each sample and pathways present in less than 10% of the samples were not included in the comparison analysis.

# Statistical analysis

Data were presented as means ± SEM. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc test for repeated measures were used for the analysis of the statistical significance of the colitis clinical scores between treatments. For other analysis, a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test and one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc test was used to determine nonparametric data and continuous variables, respectively. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed with SPSS 21.0 K for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
