# IV. EXOSOME-INDUCED MODULATION IN IBD

Exosomes contain molecular particles from their parental cells, including RNAs and proteins. While the composition of exosomal proteins differs according to the cell and tissue of origin, they also have an evolutionarily conserved common set of protein molecules. These molecular constituents are responsible for the functional activities of the exosome. Exosomes are involved in immunomodulation via the functional transfer of miRNAs, mRNAs and other constituents between immune cells. Xu et al. (2016) studied two small GTPases involved in exosomal secretion (RAB27A and RAB27B) and reported increased levels of RAB27A- and RAB27B-positive immune cells in the colonic mucosa of individuals with active UC in comparison with healthy controls (Xu et al., 2016). This indicates the crucial role of exosome-mediated immune responses in the pathogenesis of IBD. Further investigations of exosomal components with respect to IBD pathogenesis, progression, diagnosis and treatment are likely to lead to important advances.

# (1) Exosomal proteins

Typical exosomal-associated proteins linked with the regulatory functions of the exosome include the endosomal proteins Alix and tumour susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), and the tetraspanin proteins CD63, CD9 and CD81. The therapeutic potential of exosomes is usually rationalized on the basis of the presence of biologically relevant proteins or RNAs in exosomes. However, a recent review (Toh et al., 2018) based on MSC-derived exosomes, considered their physical presence, biochemical functionalities, biologically relevant concentrations, as well as their potential to elicit appropriate timely biochemical responses. They conclude that MSC-derived exosomes most probably function via protein- rather than RNA-based mechanisms (Toh et al., 2018).

# (a) Immune cell modulation

Macrophages are important in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, and their regulation is reported to be crucial in the pathogenesis of IBD, with some evidence to support the involvement of exosomes in the activation of macrophages. Systemically administered exosomes obtained from bone marrow MSCs greatly attenuate colitis in various models of IBD (Liu et al., 2019). The treatment caused polarization of M2b macrophages without leading to intestinal fibrosis, maintained the integrity of the intestinal barrier and down-modulated inflammatory responses. These exosomes were found to be enriched in proteins that participate in the regulation of multiple biological anti-colitis activities, particularly metallothionein-2 which is involved in the inhibition of inflammatory responses (Liu et al., 2019). Wong et al. (2016) investigated the potential participation of circulating exosomal proteins in the activation of macrophages by inducing acute colitis in mice and isolating their serum exosomes. Proteomic and bioinformatics analysis of the serum after treatment with RAW264.7 macrophages identified 56 proteins (mainly acute-phase proteins and immunoglobulins) which are particularly involved in the complement and coagulation cascade, leading to activation of macrophages (Wong et al., 2016). This finding links the modulation of macrophages by exosomal proteins with IBD pathogenesis.

Hookworms are known to create an immunomodulatory environment within their host. Their ability to suppress inflammation effectively led to their use in clinical trials to treat IBD (Helmby, 2015). Recently, helminth-secreted exosome-like EVs have been characterized and their functions in host–parasite interactions investigated (Eichenberger et al., 2018b). EVs from Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (a roundworm used as a model for human hookworm) contained 81 proteins including common exosomal proteins such as tetraspanin, 14-3-3 protein, enolase and heat shock proteins, together with 52 miRNA species. These components acted to protect mice against colitis inflammation by significantly suppressing cytokines [γ-interferon (IFNγ), IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-17a] related to colitis pathology and upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Eichenberger et al., 2018a). Figure 3 shows the general modulatory features of exosomes on the immune system.

# (b) Gut-microbiome modulation

Many factors including genetic, microbial, dietary, environmental and chemical can lead to altered gut-microbiome composition and diversity, causing dysbiosis – a characteristic marker of IBD (Ocansey et al., 2019). The ability of exosomes to regulate the gut microbiome needs further exploration. The functions of several exosomal heat shock proteins such as HSP20, HSP27, HSP70, HSP72, HSP73, αBC and HSP90 have been investigated, including in the pathogenesis of IBD (Clayton, 2005; Samborski & Grzymisławski, 2015; Reddy et al., 2018). Examples of such modulatory influences on the microbiome are exosomal HSP70 utilization of gram-negative bacteria receptors (Toll-like receptor 4; TLR4) and gram-positive bacteria receptors (TLR2) to stimulate proinflammatory responses, and exosomal HSP72 in the functions of IECs (Asea et al., 2002; Samborski & Grzymisławski, 2015).
