# of administration

In investigating the dose dependency of MSC therapy in colitis, Robinson et al. reported that, increasing doses above 1 × 106 MSCs does not add additional therapeutic benefits than 1 × 106 MSCs in preventing enteric neuropathy associated with intestinal inflammation [60]. Several other recent studies have also focused on enhancing the inherent therapeutic properties of MSCs to ensure consistency and efficacy in their application. For an example, the co-administration of the experimental drug MIS416 and human umbilical cord MSCs, exerted significant therapeutic efficiency consequently alleviating the symptoms of colitis as compared to the single MSC treatment [61]. The MIS416 was found to modulate the colon immune milieu via nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) and toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling activation, causing the MSCs to be readily recruited to the injury site to inhibit inflammation. Again, treatment of colitis with preconditioned MSCs resulted in an improved therapeutic effects characterized by increased body weight recovery, reduced DAI, reduced histological colitis score and decreased destruction of the epithelial barrier [62]. Further analysis revealed the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway (inducing anti-apoptotic effects), suppression of T cell proliferation and inhibition of inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-2 whilst triggering the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in T-cells.

# Application in CD

A randomized controlled clinical trial analysis reported that, umbilical cord derived MSCs were generally effective in the treatment of CD although it produced mild adverse events. At 12 months post-treatment, the Crohn’s Disease activity index (CDAI), Harvey–Bradshaw index (HBI) and corticosteroid dosage of the MSC-group, had reduced by 62.5 ± 23.2, 3.4 ± 1.2, and 4.2 ± 0.84 mg/day respectively as compared to the control group which had 23.6 ± 12.4, 1.2 ± 0.58, and 1.2 ± 0.35 mg/day reduction [54]. With regards to luminal CD, an open-label multicenter study involving 16 participants having CD refractory to biologic therapy was carried out. Among the 15 participants who completed the study, 12 (80%) had clinical response, 8 (53%) had clinical remission and 7 (47%) had endoscopic improvement [55]. The potent immunomodulatory effects exerted by MSCs during CD treatment is via complex paracrine and cell–cell contact mediated actions involving antigen-specific T cells [63].

Perianal CD occurs in approximately 25% of individuals with CD and is notoriously very difficult to treat with available biologics and surgical procedures. However, MSC therapy has shown encouraging outcomes. In their phase 3 randomized double-blind controlled trial, Panés et al. treated complex perianal fistulas in Crohn’s disease with allogeneic expanded adipose-derived MSCs. Results of intention-to-treat protocol indicated that, 53/107 (50%) of MSC treated patients achieved combined remission as against 36/105 (34%) of placebo treated patients. In modified intention-to-treat populations, MSC verses placebo resulted in 53/103 (51%) and 36/101 (36%) remission rates respectively [48]. Other documented evidence of MSC efficacy and safety in Crohn’s fistula include complete healing in 21/26 patients (80.8%) in modified per protocol analysis and 27/36 patients (75.0%) in modified intention-to-treat analysis [64] and 71% in a phase II clinical trial [65]. These among other studies have shown the efficacy and safety of MSC-based therapy in CD even in those that do not respond to conventional and/or biological treatments.

Despite the increasing trend in interest and significant clinical efficacy of MSC therapy in IBD, it is still confronted with unresolved challenges. Just as discussed in FMT, MSC therapy also has issues of administration protocol (route, dosage, schedule), origin and type of MSCs (autologous or allogeneic), quality of preparation and selection of experimental or clinical design to ensure optimum therapeutic impart. Conditions that potentiate the functions and desired effects of MSCs should further be investigated.

# Combined therapeutic effects

Fundamentally, the gut microbiota and host’s immune system inter-depend on each other by shaping the development, composition and functions of one another [66]. Invariably, MSC-therapy does not only aim at restoring the desired host immune response but also correct the altered gut microbiota whilst FMT restores gut dysbiosis resulting in dampened inflammation. These functions interlace and may even yield higher therapeutic influence when co-administered since the few existing investigations report the close communication and enhanced functionality of each other in their interactions [47, 67–70, 71].

The therapeutic imparts of MSCs do not necessarily rely on their full cellular engraftment, but rather on their capability to express trophic factors and hinder pathogenic immune reactions, favoring tissue repair [72, 73]. To this effect, conditioned-MSCs effectively alleviated colitis at both the inductive and recovery phases by producing these factors of anti-inflammation, proliferation and tissue remodeling [73]. It has also been demonstrated that, the microbiota intensely participate in the modulation of several host metabolic pathways, which cause the activation of immune-inflammatory axes and signaling pathways [74]. These functions among other desired
