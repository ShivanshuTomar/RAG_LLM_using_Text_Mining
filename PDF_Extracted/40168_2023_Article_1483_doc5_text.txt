ml,  p = 0.031), reflecting augmented pro-inflammatory responses to MMTV.

As exogenous MMTV is milk borne, evidence of enteral infection can be found in weanling pup stomachs [14]. Accordingly, we made viral preparations from stomach lactoserum using the cell pellets from the stomach as controls and cloned total RNA into next-generation sequencing libraries using a capture method to enrich the Betaretrovirus sequences. By comparing read abundance in the Illumina sequencing libraries, more than a tenfold enrichment of MMTV reads was observed in the IL-10−/− compared to the SvEv WT lactoserum libraries (Table 1). Calculations of genome equivalents derived by RT-qPCR prior to the capture enrichment revealed a viral abundance of approximately 3.0 × 108 in the IL-10−/− lactoserum consistent with milk-borne infection [14]. The increased representation of MMTV reads in lactoserum versus cell pellet libraries is also consistent with enrichment of viral particles in the mouse milk (Table 1).

Analysis of the mouse milk viral prep showed that over half of the Illumina reads in the IL-10−/− lactoserum library aligned with MMTV to provide a 99.40% coverage of the viral genome (Table 1, Supplemental Fig. 1). Following assembly, blastn searches showed that the nine MMTV contigs were mainly related to the endogenous Mtv-1 loci and the exogenous MMTV(HeJ) virus from C3H mice, which is a genetic recombinant of the endogenous Mtv1 provirus and exogenous MMTV (C3H) variant [22]. The two longest contigs shared 96.4 to 97.2% identity with the MMTV(HeJ) variant, whereas the shorter contigs shared identity to env and sag genes from Mtv1 −/− lactoserum showed a degree of variability in the (Table 2). The MMTV genome derived from the longest two contigs with 98.4% identity with each other.
