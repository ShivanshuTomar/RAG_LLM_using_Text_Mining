MSC-derived exosomes downregulates inflammatory responses, maintains intestinal mucosa barrier integrity and polarizes macrophages to the M2b phenotype, without favouring intestinal fibrosis (Liu et al., 2019).

It is known that neutrophil recruitment and activation within the intestinal mucosa contributes to IBD pathogenesis. Through their myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, neutrophils migrate into the lamina propria of DSS-induced colitis causing oxidative-induced tissue damage and other detrimental effects (Segal, 2018; Zhou et al., 2018a). MSC-derived exosomes reduce colonic MPO activities, indicating inhibited neutrophil invasion (Liu et al., 2019). Several other studies have indicated promising therapeutic effects of stem cell-derived exosomes in IBD, including inhibition of T-cell proliferation and differentiation, and promoting the apoptosis of activated T cells (Mokarizadeh et al., 2012; Baghaei et al., 2019). Bone marrow MSC-derived exosomes also protect against IBD by reducing mRNA and protein levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), p65, iNOS, COX2, TNF-α and IL-1β but increasing levels of IL-10. Furthermore, oxidation-inducing factors like MPO and malondialdehyde (MDA) were downregulated while antioxidant factors like glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were increased (Yang et al., 2015).

Similarly, exosomes effectively target colon tissues of IBD mice by 12 h post injection, and significantly attenuate the severity of IBD. Expression levels of IL-10 increase whilst that of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-7, TNF-α, and iNOS genes decrease in both colon tissues and spleens of mice. Further analysis indicated that exosomes modulate this anti-inflammatory effect partially through the regulation of IL-7 expression in macrophages (Mao et al., 2017b). MSC-derived exosomes have even been applied to experimental necrotizing enterocolitis; a medical condition in which a portion of the bowel dies. Rager et al. (2016) observed that treatment with either bone marrow derived-MSCs or their extracted exosomes significantly decreased the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and intestinal permeability. Additionally, MSC-derived exosomes profoundly enhanced wound healing in IEC-6 cells (Rager et al., 2016).

# VII. FOOD-DERIVED EXOSOMES (NANOVESICLES) AND IBD

Exosomes isolated from food sources elicit strong functional, developmental, and immunomodulatory effects on IECs. The nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a vital modulator of the innate immune response, and its abnormal stimulation is linked with the pathogenesis of several diseases including IBD. Its downstream effector proteins such as IL-1β and caspase-1 are known to exhibit protective or detrimental functions in mucosal immunity (Zhen & Zhang, 2019). In a recent study (Chen, Zhou, & Yu, 2019a), ginger rhizome-derived exosome-like nanoparticles strongly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition, treatment with the vesicles hindered pathways downstream of inflammasome activation including secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, auto-cleavage of caspase-1 and pyroptotic cell death, consequently preventing the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Chen et al., 2019a). In another study, grape-derived exosome-like nanoparticles led to effects on intestinal tissue remodelling and protection (Ju et al., 2013). The lipid component of the vesicle typically aided in the induction or proliferation of Lgr5+ stem cells and in vivo targeting of intestinal stem cells. The treatment also accelerated organoid structure formation, triggered the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and enhanced expression of stem cell growth-related genes (Ju et al., 2013). Thus, these vesicles not only participate in the modulation of intestinal tissue renewal activities, but also in remodelling responses to pathological triggers.

The ability of exosome-like nanoparticles to home effectively to the inflammatory microenvironment is controlled by C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1), CXCR2 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) (Wang et al., 2015a). Deng et al. (2017) documented the influence of broccoli-derived nanoparticles in inhibiting induced colitis in mice. These exosome-like particles mediate the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in DCs, which not only prevent DC activation but also induce DC tolerance, resulting in inhibited DSS-induced colitis in all mouse models used (Deng et al., 2017). Milk-derived exosomes obtained from humans (Martin et al., 2018) and pigs (Xie et al., 2019) have also been shown to attenuate cell death and inflammation in IECs by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB and p53 pathways in the intestinal epithelium.

# VIII. THE DOUBLE ROLE OF IEC-DERIVED EXOSOMES IN IBD

Depending on the source, functional composition, micro environmental factors and other immunological factors, exosomes exhibit either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory effects leading to attenuation or progression of diseases including IBD. Under normal physiological conditions, exosomes expressed by IECs help to maintain intestinal homeostasis and functions. They participate in modulating resident immune cells, the gut microbiota, IEC proliferation and barrier integrity. Normal IECs secrete EVs that exhibit transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1)-dependent immunosuppressive activity within the mucosal microenvironment (Jiang et al., 2016). Administration of these vesicles attenuates IBD severity via induction of both Treg and immunosuppressive DCs. They are also found to be epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) dependent and show upregulated levels of TGF-β1 during IBD development in an ERK-dependent manner (Jiang et al., 2016). This demonstrates the involvement of IECs in the maintenance of intestinal tract immune balance and intestinal homeostasis.
