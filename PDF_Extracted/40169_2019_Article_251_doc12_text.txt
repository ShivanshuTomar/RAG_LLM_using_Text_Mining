of only the specific gut–bacteria responsible for eliciting desired effects in IBD treatment, would yield better outcome than the administration of the bulk fecal material. Moreover, more studies geared toward elucidating not only host–microbiome interactions but also cross-microbiome interactions are expected to improve FMT. Finally, for a prospective utility of an FMT–MSC combined therapy in IBD and other conditions, there is the need to further investigate the interaction between the components of these two therapies and clearly understand the mechanisms underlying the enhanced effects on each other. Considering the increasing interest on these two therapies and the highly promising outcome of MSC–gut microbiota communication in the few available documents, this field would soon attract more investigations and applications across many conditions with significant daily medical practice impact.

# Conclusion

The participation of gut–microbiota in the pathophysiology of IBD is well established. The gut–microbiota provide several health benefits to the host including pathogen protection, cellular regeneration and immune modulation. With the background that, alterations in the function and composition of the gut–microbiota, coupled with immune-dysregulation lead to chronic and relapsing intestinal mucosa inflammation (i.e. IBD), the application of MSCs and FMT as therapies in IBD have gain much interest. These two therapies seek to resolve the underlying dysbiosis and repair damages. Irrespective of the successes, increasing trend in interest and the significant clinical efficacy of both therapies in IBD, they are still confronted with several unresolved challenges. In the phase of these challenges, stem cells–gut microbiota interaction is fast emerging as a novel and highly promising field. In the communication between MSCs and gut microbiota, the functions of each component are improved; in that while MSC reinstates gut microbiota composition and diversity, FMT also potentiates MSC activities. This could lead to higher clinical remission rates when applied together in the IBD environment, hence the need to explore further.
