# Abstract

Background: The gut virome has been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet a full understanding of the gut virome in IBD patients, especially across diverse geographic populations, is lacking.

Results: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive gut virome-wide association study in a Chinese cohort of 71 IBD patients (15 with Crohn’s disease and 56 with ulcerative colitis) and 77 healthy controls via viral-like particle (VLP) and bulk virome sequencing of their feces. By utilizing an integrated gut virus catalog tailored to the IBD virome, we revealed fundamental alterations in the gut virome in IBD patients. These characterized 139 differentially abundant viral signatures, including elevated phages predicted to infect Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterococcus_B, Streptococcus, and Veillonella species, as well as IBD-depleted phages targeting Prevotella, Ruminococcus_E, Bifidobacterium, and Blautia species. Remarkably, these viral signatures demonstrated high consistency across diverse populations such as those in Europe and the USA, emphasizing their significance and broad relevance in the disease context. Furthermore, fecal virome transplantation experiments verified that the colonization of these IBD-characterized viruses can modulate experimental colitis in mouse models.

Conclusions: Building upon these insights into the IBD gut virome, we identified potential biomarkers for prognosis and therapy in IBD patients, laying the foundation for further exploration of viromes in related conditions.

# Background

The human gut virome represents a dynamic community of viruses inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract, primarily comprising bacteriophages with limited eukaryotic and archaeal viral presence. Factors influencing gut virome composition and diversity include genetics, diet, antibiotic use, and environmental exposures [1–4]. This complex virome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human disorders. Notably, it was first associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [5], and subsequent research linked the gut virome to conditions such as obesity, diabetes [6], metabolic syndrome [7], colorectal cancer [8], autoimmune diseases [9–11], and liver.
