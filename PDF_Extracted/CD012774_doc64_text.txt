# All outcomes

Comment: most likely done.

# Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)

Low risk

Quote: "The worst site of inflammation was assessed using the Mayo endoscopic subscore and a blinded review, and consensus scoring of endoscopic images [photographs] was done by two gastroenterologists [AjS, RM]." (page 1312)

Comment: most likely done.

# Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)

Low risk

Comment: experimental group had 1 participant lost to follow-up and 3 relapses; the control group had 8 relapses, 1 colectomy, 1 death.

# Selective reporting (reporting bias)

Low risk

Comment: all intended outcomes were reported in the paper; the trial was registered at Clinical Trials Registry – India (CTRI/2018/02/012148).

# Other bias

Low risk

Comment: no other risk of bias noted.

|Allegretti 2016|Wrong study population: cohort study that included people with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection|
|Borody 2003|Wrong study design: case series|
|Chen 2018|Wrong comparator: no comparator arm|
|Chen 2020|Wrong comparator: people with moderately to severely active UC were randomly assigned to undergo FMT 3 times on days 1, 3, and 5 by nasojejunal tube or transendoscopic enteral tubing.|
|Chin 2017|Wrong study population: included participants with IBD with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, for which FMT was used as treatment|
|Ding 2019|Wrong comparator: all participants received FMT|
|El-Nachef 2020|Wrong comparator: participants were randomized into 4 arms, all of which included FMT, no placebo arm|
|Fang 2017|Wrong comparator: of 5 participants, 2 were diagnosed with very early-onset CD, 2 had UC, and 1 had pseudomembranous colitis; they received FMT via nasojejunal tube or colonoscopy.|
