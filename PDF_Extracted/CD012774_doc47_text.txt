# Risk of bias

|Bias|Authors' judgement|Support for judgement|
|---|---|---|
|Random sequence generation (selection bias)|Low risk|Quote: "Eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 by a computer-generated randomization list maintained off-site at OpenBiome (Cambridge, MA) to ensure concealment of allocation and double blinding." (page 3)|
|Allocation concealment (selection bias)|Low risk|Quote: "The treatment allocation was blinded to the subject, and all on-site investigators and staff." (page 3)|
|Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)|Low risk|Quote: "The treatment allocation was blinded to the subject, and all on-site investigators and staff." (page 3)|
|Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)|Low risk|Quote: "The treatment allocation was blinded to the subject, and all on-site investigators and staff." (page 3)|
|Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)|High risk|Comment: 1/7 (14.3%) were excluded from analysis in experimental group, while 2/8 (25%) were excluded from analysis in control group, though each group excluded 1 due to no evidence of disease and control group excluded 1 due to worsening symptoms of disease. (page 5)|
|Selective reporting (reporting bias)|Low risk|Comment: all intended outcomes were reported in the paper. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02390726).|
|Other bias|Low risk|Comment: no other risk of bias noted.|
