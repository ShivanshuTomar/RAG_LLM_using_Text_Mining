# BACKGROUND

# Description of the condition

Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD), two subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are chronic, relapsing conditions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. One of the proposed mechanisms for the development of IBD involves the interplay between the gut microbiome and the immune system, which may lead to an abnormal inflammatory response in genetically susceptible individuals (Abraham 2009; Cleynen 2016). UC is characterized by inflammation of the colonic mucosa and can affect variable lengths of the colon. CD is characterized by transmural inflammation and can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus, with a particular predilection for the terminal ileum (Abraham 2009; Ananthakrishnan 2015). While there is regional variation in the prevalence of IBD, with the highest rates in North America, recently its prevalence has been trending upwards globally (Ahuja 2010; Dahlhamer 2016; GBD 2020; Molodecky 2012; Weintraub 2014). The Global Burden of Disease study estimated that the prevalence of IBD increased from 3.7 million to 6.8 million between 1990 and 2017 (GBD 2020). IBD is associated with poor quality of life, significant economic burden, and increased morbidity, including the need for hospitalizations and surgical procedures (Abraham 2009; Abraham 2012; Mehta 2016). Current treatment strategies for IBD focus on the control of inflammation with medications, including corticosteroids; 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) preparations; immune-modulating drugs such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate; and immune-modulating monoclonal antibodies such as infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab (Abraham 2009; Vindigni 2016). Unfortunately, these medical therapies have the potential to cause significant adverse effects. Moreover, while these therapies provide some benefit in many cases (Abraham 2009; Vindigni 2016), there remains a significant number of people who either do not respond to any of these treatment modalities or become refractory to them over time. Ultimately, some people may require surgical bowel resection (Vindigni 2016). The severity of IBD and poor outcomes justify the need for alternative treatment strategies that target known pathogenic factors to supplement or replace existing interventions.

# Description of the intervention

There is growing evidence to suggest that 'dysbiosis' is one of the key elements in the pathogenesis of IBD and could be a potential therapeutic target (Assa 2016; Bejaoui 2015; Kostic 2014; Vindigni 2016). Dysbiosis is defined as any alteration in the composition of commensal microbial communities relative to those found in healthy individuals (Petersen 2014). In IBD, a decrease in alpha diversity, an increase in pathobionts (species of resident bacteria that activate the immune system), altered production of microbial metabolites, and an altered functional core of gut microbiota relative to that of healthy individuals have been reported (Chow 2011; De Preter 2012; Kostic 2014; Vindigni 2016). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy donors is one of the interventions used to correct dysbiosis (Cammarota 2017). While FMT is increasingly studied, most of the published literature relates to the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) infection (rCDI), for which its efficacy is greater than 90% (Austin 2014; Cammarota 2015; Kassam 2013; Kelly 2016; Lee 2016; Leffler 2015; van Nood 2013; Youngster 2014).

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers FMT as a 'biologic product' and a 'drug' under its regulations and has labeled it as an investigational new drug, with exceptions for the treatment of rCDI where the FDA exercises enforcement discretion (FDA 2022; Moore 2014). Although FMT methods are evolving, a typical FMT procedure involves selection and screening of the donor, collection and preparation of the donor stool for infusion, preparation of the patient to receive the stool infusion, and administration of the stool via the upper or lower GI tract (Cammarota 2017). There is no single tool that has been universally agreed upon for donor screening; however, most studies have adopted a screening strategy similar to that used for a human tissue donor (Austin 2014; Cammarota 2017; Moore 2014; Owens 2013). The donor is screened via interview, and then blood and stool studies are conducted to rule out chronic diseases and active infections. After the donor is screened, the stool is collected either to be used immediately for infusion or frozen for later use. At least 30 g to 50 g of feces are typically collected and mixed with normal saline or sterile water in preparation for infusion, and the patient is usually prepared with a colonic lavage. The donor feces can be administered via an upper GI route, such as nasoduodenal tube and orally ingested capsules, or a lower GI route, such as colonoscopy and enema. Since the publication of the last version of this review, guidelines have been updated for both children and adults regarding the use of FMT for treatment of rCDI (Davidovics 2019; Kelly 2021; McDonald 2018). All modalities have been studied with overall comparable efficacy, although the colonic route is considered the most efficacious (Cammarota 2017; Lee 2016; van Nood 2013; Youngster 2014). Per published international standards, infection control precautions should be adopted during FMT preparation and administration (Cammarota 2017).

# How the intervention might work

The exact mechanism by which FMT might work for inducing remission in IBD is not well-established. However, the prevailing hypothesis is that FMT might correct the dysbiosis associated with IBD, leading to a reversal or improvement of the associated inflammation (Moayyedi 2015; Paramsothy 2017; Rossen 2015; Shi 2016; Sun 2016; Vindigni 2016). Knowledge around the use of FMT for treatment of IBD has been evolving. FMT impacts not only the composition of gut bacteria, but also the complex interconnected communities of viruses, fungi, protists, and archaea within the GI tract and their various by-products (Lam 2022). Currently, there is no consensus on the volume, timing, route, and frequency of fecal administration necessary to achieve remission (Cammarota 2017; Kelly 2015; Moore 2014). While a single infusion of feces is often enough to treat rCDI in most cases (Austin 2014; Cammarota 2015; Kassam 2013), multiple infusions might be required for the induction of remission in IBD, as suggested by the FOCUS trial in Australia (Paramsothy 2017). Similarly, the response to FMT in people with rCDI may not vary much with the choice of donor (Osman 2016). However, donor selection might have a significant impact on the induction of remission in UC as reported by Moayyedi 2015, in which seven of nine people who achieved clinical remission had received stool from a single donor. The short- and long-term safety of FMT in people with IBD is not well-established (Cammarota 2017; Kelly 2015; Moore 2014). Some studies report relatively minor adverse effects such as diarrhea, abdominal bloating, abdominal cramping, and fever in the immediate postprocedure period (Khoruts 2016; Kunde 2013). In addition, FMT may increase the risk of a flare in people with IBD.
