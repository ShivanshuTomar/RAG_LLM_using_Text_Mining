unlikely to have biased our data; (3) while microbiome data was collected via rectal swab instead of directly via mucosal biopsy, prior studies have shown this mainly affects diversity, not OTU abundance [48]; (4) the change in our cytokine expression was small; however, if each pinch biopsy is approximately 4mm2 and the average colon is 2m2 in surface area then an increase in 1 unit of secretion represents greater than 30,000-fold increase in expression of that cytokine in the colon as a whole. Some subjects displayed high IEL production of certain cytokines; however, subjects producing high levels of one cytokine were not the same for other cytokines. The presence of cytokine secretion was not driven by outliers, as data for TNF-α and IFN-γ graphed on a logarithmic axis demonstrate the full range of values; (5) histologic evidence of disease activity was not assessed when subjects lacked symptoms such as change in bowel function, but all subjects lacked visible evidence of mucosal inflammation; (6) finally, the observational study design did not permit evaluation of causal links between alterations in microbiome and IEL function.

In spite of these limitations, our data provide provocative insights into how the intestinal microbiome interacts with mucosal immune cells to contribute to disease pathogenesis within human subjects. Our findings demonstrate a complex relationship between IEL-produced cytokines and microbial diversity.

# Conclusion

The findings of this study indicate differences in IEL function among subjects with axSpA, CD, and UC compared to healthy controls. Our findings demonstrate unique correlation between altered microbiota and IEL function in these distinct populations. We believe the unique interactions between microbiota and IEL function by disease state is relevant to the pathogenesis of disease. Additional research is needed to validate these findings, yet our results give credence to the hypothesis that the gut microbiome is an important mediator in the development of IBD and axSpA.
