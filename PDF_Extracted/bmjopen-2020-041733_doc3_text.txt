# Biosamples

A stool sample is collected for faecal microbiome, inflammatory markers and short-chain fatty acids. A urine sample is collected for metabolomics, and blood samples are taken for DNA isolation as well as for serum for inflammatory markers (ie, cytokines, chemokines, high-sensitivity C reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide) and metabolomic profile (eg, tryptophan metabolites, growth factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotransmitters such as GABA and serotonin, and stress hormones such as cortisol) at each study visit. All biosamples are shipped to Population Health Research Institute (PHRI) for storing at −80°C.

# Data management
