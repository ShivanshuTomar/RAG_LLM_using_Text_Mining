For MC the main distinguishing family was the Rikinellaceae, with Alistipes significantly enriched in MC patients relative to Healthy Controls (p &lt; 0.05, Supplementary Table 16). We found no evidence of Akkermansia being decreased in MC patients as previously described 23,29, though the low sample number in the MC cohort could be a reason for this.

Taxonomic changes leads to microbiomes of differing functional capacities. Combined, our diversity, composition, and taxonomic data demonstrate that the microbiome changes IBD conditions and in the case of CD, can be different for the same condition at different GI locations. We next wanted to understand how these observed changes impact the functionality of the microbiome, with a particular focus on molecules important for colonocyte health and immunomodulation, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile-acids30–32. We used the tool PiCRUSt2 to develop predicted metagenomes based on 16S rRNA sequencing data 20.

There were significant differences in the composition of functional pathways in the gut microbiome between different IBD conditions (p &gt; 0.05 in all cases, Supplementary Table 17). We identified 71 pathways that were differentially abundant between microbiome of patients with CD and healthy controls (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 18). CD patients had a decreased abundance of multiple pathways responsible for the generation and transformation of propionate and butyrate. Specifically, CD patients had significantly reduced abundance in pathways for the generation of propionate and butyrate from carbohydrate degradation, including the pathways, pyruvate to propionate (P108_PWY), acetyl-CoA to butyrate (PWY_5677), succinate to butyrate (PWY_5676), and propanediol degradation to propionate (PWY_7013). CD patients were also reduced in amino-acid metabolism to butyrate (PWY_163). Loss of SCFAs was coupled with the microbiome having reduced capacity for vitamin K2 production (PWY_5896, POLYAMINSYN3_PWY, PWY_6263, PWY_5850, PWY_5845), a microbially derived nutrient important for healing 33. As well as the reduction in pathways which produce molecules critical for the host’s health, the gut microbiome of CD patients was increased in pathways for the degradation of aromatic compounds (CATECHOL.ORTHO.CLEAVAGE.PWY) including salicylate (PWY.6182) which is often used for the treatment of CD and UC 34. An increase in antimicrobial resistance genes (beta-lactam) was also observed (PWY_6470), perhaps due to the associated increase of opportunistic pathogens.

When stratifying by disease location, although CD-TI was similar taxonomic diversity and composition to healthy controls, all CD disease locations had a significant reduction relative to healthy controls in the pathways responsible for butyrate production from both acetyl-CoA fermentation (PWY_5676) and amino acid fermentation (P163_PWY). This suggests some functional redundancy. Despite this, all specific locations had unique profiles for metabolic pathways. CD-TI patients were enriched for pyruvate to butyrate fermentation (CENTFERM_PWY) relative to CD-SB and CD-CC. CD-SB was enriched for succinate fermentation to butyrate relative to CD-CC and CD-TI (PWY.5677), and only CD-CC patients were enriched for beta-lactam resistance (PWU_6470) and menaquinol (vitamin K2) production. This data illustrates that although CD patients are deficient in several key pathways relative to healthy controls, when grouping patients by site-specific location, the dynamics are more complex with each specific site of CD having its own functional deficiency.

UC patients were deficient for the key SCFA pyruvate to propionate pathway (P108.PWY), with an increase in UC patients for the pyruvate to isobutanol pathway (PWY.7111) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 19). Unlike CD patients, UC patients had no clear deficiencies in butyrate pathways compared to the healthy controls, nor did they have any evidence for deficiency in pathways involved in butyrate production or aromatic degradation. This demonstrates that the taxonomic differences observed between UC and CD patients resulted in different microbiome functionality, with UC having reduced SCFA relative to healthy controls but not to the extent of CD patients.

For MC patients, healthy controls were enriched for fermentation to acetone, of which many genes are common with SCFA pathways, such as the production of acetoacetyl-CoA (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 21). However, other than this, there were no clear reduction in the metabolic function of the microbiome for MC patients (Fig. 3), with more patient samples likely needed to explore function in the MC cohort further.

# Discussion

The role of the microbiome is linked to both the causation and progression of IBD 5. As our understanding of the microbiome has increased, it has become clear that observations based on a cohort level do not satisfactorily capture the subtle dynamics underlying this complex group of diseases. This has led to a number of studies publishing results which contradict one-another in both the key taxa present and the factors that could contribute to disease 3–11. Here, we aimed to understand what the microbiome taxonomic and functional signatures were across three unique IBD conditions and at different locations of disease presentation. This was in order to increase our knowledge of the complex dynamics of the microbiome in IBD and to highlight how the strategies by which studies are stratified can influence our understanding and interpretation of the microbiome in patients with IBD. From the data and analysis collected in this study, we demonstrate that when analysing IBD at a high level classification, the role of the microbiome in Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and microscopic colitis, are vastly different given their different compositions, taxonomic markers, and functional capacity. Depending on whether we analysed data as IBD versus Healthy, stratified by IBD Condition (CD vs MC vs UC), or stratified by IBD condition and location, conclusions on microbiome diversity, composition, and function significantly changed. Importantly, this means different studies analysing IBD that have differences in stratification strategies will produce different results owing to the different signatures present across conditions, and in the case of CD, across different disease locations. For some studies, results inferred at a cohort-wide level, potentially will not apply to subsets of the IBD population. This has important implications for both therapeutic and diagnostic design and validation.

Our observed changes in microbiome taxonomic composition and diversity were widely reflected in predictions of functional capacity. Whilst marker based metagenomic inference has limitations in relation to direct
