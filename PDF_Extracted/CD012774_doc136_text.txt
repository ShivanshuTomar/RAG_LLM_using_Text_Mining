# Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

In the previous version of this review, we planned for subgroup analyses based on age of participants and frequency of FMT administration; however, there were not enough studies available to perform these subgroup analyses. In this update, we attempted subgroup analyses based on these two variables.

Given that we performed an ITT analysis, which included randomized participants who may not have received the intervention and completed follow-up, we also performed post-hoc available case analyses for the primary outcomes in which only those participants were included who completed follow-up.

We updated the post-hoc analysis conducted in the last version of the review for studies that defined induction of remission using a combination of clinical and endoscopic/histologic criteria.
