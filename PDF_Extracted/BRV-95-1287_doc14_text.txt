# Exosomes and IBD

Therapeutic proteins, RNAs and other molecules, exosomes have also been engineered to deliver imaging particles to sites of interest. They have been identified as crucial mediators of distant intercellular communication and participate in a diverse range of biological activities and processes. They are noted to have an ideal native structure and characteristics that make their use as nanocarriers in clinical and experimental settings highly promising. Among these special characteristics are their small size making it easy to penetrate into deep tissues, pliable cytoskeleton, high probability of escaping degradation or immune system clearance, and their resemblance to cell membranes (Hood, 2016). The two major mechanisms by which therapeutic substances are incorporated into exosomes are passive and active encapsulation, which both result in different drug-loading stabilities and efficiencies.

# (1) Passive encapsulation

In this method, drugs are incubated with either parental cells or extracted exosomes. The drugs move via a concentration gradient into the extracted exosomes or into the parental cells and trigger the cells to secrete exosomes loaded with the treated drugs. For example, when MSCs were treated with Paclitaxel, the extracted exosomes were found to contain significant amounts of the drug and showed greater efficacy than untreated cells (Pascucci et al., 2014). Sun et al. (2010) reported that the passive encapsulation of curcumin into exosomes heightened their anti-inflammatory effects. They further validated that employing exosomes as a delivery vehicle for the drug made it highly stable, more concentrated in plasma and more target-specific to inflammatory cells. In the delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs like curcumin into the IBD microenvironment, factors such as pH are also important to consider (Beloqui et al., 2014). As has engineering hybrid exosomes by membrane fusion of liposomes and exosomes (Sato et al., 2016).

# (3) Application of exosomes as nanocarriers in IBD

The use of exosomes in nanotechnology is increasingly becoming a promising technique for the treatment of IBD. Although the inflamed colonic environment presents challenges such as a disrupted epithelium, a thick mucus layer, and altered colonic transit time, it is generally reported that nano-sized drug-delivery systems are able to overcome such barriers, leading to increased accumulation within the inflamed tissue. This ultimately leads to increased quantities of the drug in the colon with corresponding increases in efficacy and a reduced likelihood of systemic side effects (Beloqui, Coco, & Préat, 2016). Endogenous annexin A1 (ANXA1) is produced as a component of EVs obtained from IECs. This protein is known to regulate intestinal mucosal injuries, inflammation and repair (Babbin et al., 2008). In nanocarrier technology, local administration of exogenous ANXA1 mimetic peptide, encapsulated within targeted polymeric nanoparticles accelerates healing of murine colonic wounds. In the same study, a single systemic administration speeds up recovery after an experimentally induced colitis (Leoni et al., 2015). Oral administration of PLGA/PLA–PEG-FA nanoparticles loaded with the ginger active compound 6-shogaol (NPs-PEG-FA/6-shogaol) in a colitis model significantly mitigates colitis symptoms and accelerates colitis wound repair by modulating the anti-inflammatory factors nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and iNOS. NPs-PEG-FA was also shown to be highly biocompatible with efficient receptor-mediated uptake by activated Raw 264.7 macrophages and colon-26 cells (Zhang et al., 2018a).

# (2) Active encapsulation

Active encapsulation relies on drug molecules (the active agent) crossing the membrane of the exosome into the core and becoming entrapped. To achieve this, several methods have been used to compromise membrane integrity to allow diffusion without affecting the inherent structure and functions of the exosome. Methods such as extrusion and sonication temporarily disrupt the membrane structure and increase porosity, allowing the drug molecules to enter the exosome (Liao et al., 2019). Other methods include electroporation, freeze and thaw cycles and the use of membrane-permeable substances. Electroporation utilizes an electrical field to create small pores in the phospholipid bilayer, allowing transient diffusion of the drug followed by recovery of the exosome membrane after loading. The use of surfactants like saponin both increase the membrane permeability of exosomes and also preserve the activities of the loaded drug (Haney et al., 2015). Freezing at −80C followed by thawing has also been used successfully to load particles into exosomes.

A number of biomarkers are known to be relevant to IBD, however, none have yet been identified as a single biomarker for its diagnosis or that can differentiate UC patients from CD patients with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.
