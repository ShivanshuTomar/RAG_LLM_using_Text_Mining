# Application in CD

Increasing evidence indicates the promising outcome of FMT as an encouraging treatment option for Crohn’s disease (CD). However, the frequency of FMT for CD treatment remains unclear. In the first study that demonstrate that FMT could be a possible therapeutic option for CD, metagenomic analysis of stool microbiota indicated an evidence of FMT engraftment in 7/9 (78%) of participants. Analysis based on pediatric Crohn’s disease activity index showed 7/9 participants in clinical remission at 2 weeks and 5/9 patients who did not receive further medication in clinical remission at 6 and 12 weeks [43]. In another study, Vaughn et al. documented an encouraging clinical response rate of 11/19 (58%) in CD patients who received FMT treatment [39]. This was a consequence of a significant shift in patients’ fecal microbial diversity and composition towards their donor’s profile. Patients’ lamina propria also witnessed increased regulatory T-cells (CD4+ CD25+ CD127lo) following FMT treatment. A single FMT administration in children with active IBD including CD, resulted in a clinical response rate of 57% and 28% at 1 and 6 months post FMT respectively. Adverse events ranged from mild to moderate and self-limiting reactions [44]. This indicates that, although single FMT administration is safe in children, it is confronted with short-lived clinical response. In the quest to retain a long term remission in the first treatment in CD, Li et al. estimated the optimal timing for a second FMT administration. They concluded that, patients with CD could be given the second course of FMT in less than 4 months after the first FMT [45].

It is undoubtedly clear that the exploitation of the gut microbiome could produce a great therapeutic novelty. However, there is poor and limited knowledge on microbiota modulation in IBD, hence the necessity for further in-depth investigations. In order to achieve a reliable safety and efficacy assessment with solid conclusion on FMT application in IBD, it is essential to mount more randomized controlled trials. Again, the frequency of FMT administration, standardization of microbiome analysis and donor selection should also be intently investigated. Other optimal parameters of FMT effects with regard to route of administration, volume, preparation, and the type and disease severity should also be defined. Additionally, studies to assess the long-term FMT-mediated maintenance of clinical remission in CD and UC should be carried out.

# MSC therapy in IBD

The functions of MSCs spanning from cell replacement to immunosuppression and trophic factors production, have gain a lot of interest with increasing application in regenerative medicine and immune intervention in both experimental models and clinical trials. MSCs are known to interact with inflammatory cytokines and greatly influence both adaptive and innate immune systems via producing immunomodulatory particles that control the progression of inflammation by affecting cells like macrophages, T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells and B cells [46, 47]. By employing these properties, MSC application in IBD has been applied to achieve cellular replacement, immunosuppression and other trophic actions, together resulting in highly promising outcomes in clinical trials [48, 49] and experimental studies [50, 51]. MSC-therapy in IBD is mainly administered through systemic infusion or local inoculation. MSC extracts have also been applied in certain conditions. In one study that sought to overcome the low homing capacity of MSCs and augment their therapeutic influence, MSC extracts were used instead of whole cells in treating severe refractory IBD. Results indicated that the MSC extracts were highly potent than whole MSCs in reducing DAI, nitrite levels and the histological score. The extract totally inhibited the induction of inflammatory cytokines, recovered the destroyed epithelial barriers and shifted macrophage from M1 to M2 via reducing the levels of Chemokine (C–X–C motif ) ligand 9 (CXCL9), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), but increasing the expression of Chemokine (C–C motif ) ligand 1 (CCL1), IL-10, and Arg-1 [52]. Some clinical trials involving MSC-based therapy in IBD are summarized in Table 2.

# Application in UC

Several clinical trial studies have investigated the safety and therapeutic influence of MSCs in UC. In one of such studies, the diffused and deep ulcers formed as well as severely inflamed mucosa of 30/36 (83%) participants were greatly improved at 1 month post MSC treatment [53]. Systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical and experimental studies was recently conducted on
