specific microbe in a microbiome is the key responsible for a specific function remains largely unknown. Some metabolites—like succinate—are produced and consumed by both the microbiome and the host. On the host side, succinate is a key intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and thus intricately related to host metabolic homeostasis. On the microbiome side, succinate is an intermediate product of anaerobic carbohydrate fermentation and thus related to microbial energy production [3]. This intersection of host and microbiome metabolism poses a challenge for host regulation: while the host might attempt to regulate how succinate is produced and used, its regulatory control does not expand to the microbiome. As a result, disruptions in how succinate is produced and consumed by the microbiome can have a multifaceted impact on the host. In a healthy gut, succinate is rapidly converted into propionate [4–6], which in turn is readily absorbed by the host epithelium [7]. However, elevated concentrations of succinate measured in human feces have been associated with intestinal inflammation [8–11], suggesting a pro-inflammatory effect of excess circulating succinate. Consequently, microbes that metabolize succinate have been suggested to alleviate this inflammatory effect [12, 13].

Only few bacteria are known to anaerobically consume succinate. Various intestinal bacteria—including for example many Bacteroidaceae—produce propionate from sugars via the succinate pathway [14, 15] and in some cases export the intermediate succinate due to the low energetic yield of converting succinate to propionate [16]. But these succinate producers have generally not been observed to take up and convert succinate when supplied extracellularly. Succinate can also be otherwise utilized by select bacteria. For example, Veillonella parvula can decarboxylate succinate during lactate consumption to produce propionate and increase growth yield [17], and Clostridioides difficile can convert succinate to butyrate to rebalance NADH. However, a substantial consumption of extracellular succinate has only been demonstrated for isolates of the Negativicutes, including Phascolarctobacterium spp. [4, 18] and Dialister spp. [19–21]. Overall, the degree to which these different taxa and pathways are active in the human intestine remains poorly understood.

# Human gut microbiota differ in their ability and rate to metabolize succinate in vitro

To understand succinate consumption in complex intestinal microbiota, we performed in vitro enrichments of feces from 13 different human donors akin to what is described in Anthamatten et al. [22]. Briefly, we inoculated diluted fecal samples in triplicate into a defined base medium either supplemented with 30 mM of succinate as main carbon source or a non-supplemented control and measured (i) how much of succinate was consumed after 2 and 7 days of strict anaerobic cultivation and (ii) what metabolites were produced in return (Fig. 1a). Because of the stochasticity with respect to diluted inoculum composition, we analyzed each replicate independently.

The time required to consume the supplied succinate differed between enrichment cultures (Fig. 1b), with all of the supplied succinate consumed within 48 h in some enrichments and no succinate consumed in others after 7 days. We thus classified the enrichments into four categories as a function of their succinate consumption: “fast,” “intermediate,” “slow,” and “non-consumers.” Fast enrichments consumed > 90% of the supplied succinate within the first 48 h of cultivation (n = 11/39), intermediate enrichments consumed > 90% within 7 days (10/39), slow enrichments consumed between 20 and 90% within 7 days (6/39), and non-consuming enrichments consumed < 20% within 7 days (12/39). Enrichments inoculated with the same fecal sample were generally consistent in terms of category, with M1 to M4 fast, M5 intermediate, M6 and M7 slow, and M8 to M13 non-consumers, although we did observe differences in the categories between replicates. This suggests that specific properties of the fecal sample contribute—at least in part—to the category of succinate consumption, for example specific taxa or different metabolic pathways. The optical density at 48 h was...
