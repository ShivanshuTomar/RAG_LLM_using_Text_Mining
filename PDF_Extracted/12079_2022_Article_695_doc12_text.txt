# Role of interleukin-6-mediated inflammation in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease

Pathological alterations and reduced the mRNA levels of IL-6. Lactobacillus murinus, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 615, and Ruminiclostridium KB18 as pathogenic species were found in the gut microbiome of mice with colitis and treatment with ginger reduced Muribaculaceae, resulting in regulation of the gut microbiome structure in DDS-induced colitis mice models (Guo et al. 2021). It has been reported that treatment with water-soluble garlic polysaccharide (WSGP) reduces colonic damage and levels of IL-6 in DSS-induced colitis mice models. Furthermore, WSGP boosted the production of SCFAs and enhanced the mucosal barriers and the gut microbiome composition (Shao et al. 2020).

Butyrate is a kind of SCFAs and is negatively associated with colitis development. An investigation demonstrated that the administration of butyrate pointedly reversed the signs of colitis and improved colonic histological injury by reducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and increasing the expression of CCR9 chemokine in DSS-induced colitis mice models. However, it was found that these therapeutic effects were performed in collaboration with CCR9 + myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) as an immunosuppressive cell. Therefore, butyrate alone could not have a significant effect on the treatment of colitis (Xiao et al. 2021).

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is another anti-inflammatory factor with promising effects in the treatment of colitis. It has been revealed that DHEA administration in DSS-induced colitis mice could reduce IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. DHEA also improved colon barrier integrity and modulated gut microbiota composition to decrease inflammatory responses in the intestine (Cao et al. 2020).

One of the most important risk factors for colitis and CRC is high-fat diets, which change the gut microbiome composition (Zhu et al. 2021). An investigation explored the therapeutic effects of Evodiamine (EVO) in DDS-induced mice models. This study showed that the numbers of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were amplified in patients with CRC, whereas Bifidobacterium, Campylobacter and Lactobacillus were reduced. Additionally, the levels of p-STAT3 were significantly elevated in these patients. Furthermore, treating mice with EVO and 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) could inhibit tumor formation, reduce tumor cell proliferation, and induce tumor cell apoptosis. The numbers of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were reduced, while the frequency of Lactobacillus, Campylobacter, and Bifidobacterium was increased in treated mice. Furthermore, the IL-6/STAT3/P65 pathway was inhibited in treated mice with EVO (Zhu et al. 2021).

Shenling Baizhu San (SLBZS) is another complementary medical therapy for UC by improving the function of the intestinal barrier and modulating the gut microbiome pattern by increasing the number of Oscillospira and Prevotella, which produce SCFA, and decreasing the number of pathogenic bacteria such as Bilophila and Desulfovibrio. Furthermore, the expression of IL-6 and MPO was significantly reduced after therapy (Gu et al. 2020).

Oral administration of resveratrol also could have therapeutic effects in (DSS)-induced colitis mice model through balancing the gut microbiota composition and reducing the production of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, and CXCL1. Moreover, resveratrol can significantly reduce the number of Bilophila, Sutterella, Akkermansia, and Dorea. Additionally, resveratrol increases the abundance of Bifidobacterium in mice with colitis (Li et al. 2020).

The protective effects of an extracted polysaccharide (SP) from Gracilaria Lemaneiformis were investigated in DDS-induced mice models, and results disclosed that this extract could recover physical conditions of the studied mice by reducing weight loss and suppressing appetite. Furthermore, SP also repressed the release of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in inflamed colon tissue. The expression of tight junction proteins is also upregulated following treatment with SP to enhance the intestinal barrier (Han et al. 2020).

Egg white peptides (EWPs) can regulate the content of microbiota through their anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation properties. Treatment of mice with colitis with 200 mg/kg of EWPs showed an increased number of Candidatus Saccharimonas and Lactobacillus and decreased the number of Akkermansia and Ruminiclostridium. Moreover, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α decreased following this treatment in DDS-induced colitis mice models (Ge et al. 2021).

Self-assembled nanoparticles (NPs) incidentally formed throughout food processing. The advantage of these food incidental NPs is that they can directly access the GI and modulate the composition of the gut microbiome. Food incidental NPs increased the abundance of beneficial bacterial species such as Alloprevotella, Muribaculaceae, and Alistipes and decreased the number of harmful species such as Helicobacter. Moreover, the correlation analysis showed that pro-inflammatory cytokines were negatively correlated with Muribaculaceae, Alloprevotella, and Alistipes but positively correlated with Helicobacter to balance the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 (Wang et al. 2022).

Other studies have shown that compounds such as Berberine, Rhein, and algal oil rich in docosahexaenoic acid in a similar behavior reduce inflammation by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, as well as improving intestinal mucosal barrier and microbiome composition (Yang et al. 2021; Deng et al. 2022; Dong et al. 2022).

# Probiotics

Some bacterial species include Lactobacillus helveticus KLDS 1.8701, Lactobacillus plantarum KLDS 1.0318, and Lactobacillus acidophilus KLDS 1.0901 could have immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties.
