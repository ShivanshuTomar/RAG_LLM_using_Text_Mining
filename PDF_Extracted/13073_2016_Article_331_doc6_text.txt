The overall dataset including both cases and controls, one unit increase in microbial dysbiosis (overall mean – 1.3 ± 0.74) was associated with a 260-point increase in calprotectin (p = 0.0004). This finding also held true when examining cases only: a one-unit increase in dysbiosis (case mean –1.06 ± 0.66) associated with 286 μg/g higher calprotectin (p = 0.02, Additional file 2: Figure S3A). This is the first time the dysbiosis characteristic of the CD gut microbiome has been linked to a clinical measure of inflammation: fecal calprotectin. In contrast, we found that the Shannon alpha diversity did not show a relationship with calprotectin (Additional file 2: Table S5). Our results were not impacted by using a de novo OTU-picking approach or rarefying reads from each sample from the closed-OTU-picking biom file to even depth (see Additional file 3).

For our Crohn’s patients, dysbiosis also significantly associated with increased PCDAI, the current clinical measure of disease activity (p = 0.0001, Additional file 2: Figure S3B). However, PCDAI did not associate significantly with calprotectin (Additional file 2: Table S5, Additional file 2: Figure S3C), suggesting that PCDAI is not a good stand-in for a direct measure of inflammation such as calprotectin.

# Gut microbiome differences between groups

While the dysbiosis index has predictive power of whether an individual has CD [19], we found that the baseline dysbiosis index was not significantly different (p = 0.3) between treatment responders, who showed evidence of mucosal healing (n = 6), and non-responders (n = 13). This finding suggests that baseline dysbiosis may identify cases, but may not be the best tool for predicting actual response to treatment. Because the components of the dysbiosis index are broad categories (i.e., family- and order-level taxa), we next used GEE (again with Wald tests for coefficient significance) to test whether distinct microbiome signatures could be identified among responders and non-responders at the genus level. Using GEE allowed us to leverage the power of all of our time points to test differences, both between cases and controls and between non-responders and responders.

We found that 20 genera had nominally significantly different abundance (p ≤ 0.05) between cases and controls at baseline. Interestingly, 7 of these 20 genera were not captured by the dysbiosis index. We also found 18 genera that differed significantly at baseline between responders and non-responders, 5 of which were not captured in the dysbiosis index. The taxa that differ between groups are summarized in Fig. 3 and Additional file 2: Table S6.

When we compared the list of significantly different genera between cases and controls to the significant genera from our non-responder/responder comparison, 11 of these taxa overlapped. The direction of effect in all overlapping taxa was the same in the two comparisons: if a genus was significantly increased in cases compared to controls, that genus was likewise increased in our non-responders compared to responders.

Because of our limited sample size, this analysis was largely exploratory: only two taxa, Coprococcus and Adlercreutzia, met the threshold for significance in the case/control comparison (no taxon met this threshold in our non-responder/responder comparisons) after conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, with a significant p value defined as <0.05/134. Coprococcus was decreased in cases compared to controls and further decreased in non-responders compared to responders. Adlercreutzia was also decreased in cases compared to controls but was at similar levels in non-responders and responders. While the association of Coprococcus with IBD has long been known, the association with Adlercreutzia has not been previously reported.

# Predicting future response to treatment via the gut microbiome using pretreatment samples

We used a random forest classifier to determine if treatment response among cases could be predicted using microbiome data from the first pretreatment sample from each individual. Five responders and 12 non-responders had pretreatment samples for analysis. We combined patients with UC and CD because the IBD subtype explained only 4 % of the variability in the weighted UniFrac distance between pretreatment samples after accounting for responder/non-responder status, which explained 23 % of the variability (p = 0.01 after 10,000 permutations). Our classifier attained an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.75 (Fig. 4a) and 76.5 % accuracy of prediction (significant at p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively, after 10,000 permutations of treatment response/non-response status). The confusion matrix and precision-recall curves for our random forest model can be found in Additional file 2: Table S7 and Additional file 2: Figure S4, respectively. Because the prediction error among responders in this model is high (60 %), we were concerned that only non-responders had a distinctive pattern; this could also lead to a higher prediction error (lower accuracy) than reported here among populations having a higher proportion of responders. To investigate this, we additionally used a subsampling approach to fit our random forest classifier, so that each tree was fit using 5 responders and 5 non-responders. This model has the same overall prediction accuracy (76.5 %), but the prediction error in responders (20 %) and non-responders (25 %) is more comparable, suggesting that both responders and non-responders have distinct OTU profiles. These results also suggest that the prediction accuracy we report here is achievable even in
