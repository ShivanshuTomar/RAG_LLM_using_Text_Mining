Biological effect evaluation of the gut virome on DSS-induced colitis in mice. a Schematic diagram of the construction of the DSS-induced mouse model of colitis. b Bar plot showing the microbial composition of the feces of mice before and after FVT. c Evaluation of the disease activity index in colitis mice that received gut viromes from IBD patients and healthy controls. d Colon length of mice with colitis. e Representative images of hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of the mouse colon. f The expression levels of adhesion and tight junction-related proteins in the mice with colitis. g Levels of inflammatory cytokines in the colon of colitis mice. N = 6. Statistical tests were performed using Studentâ€™s t-test: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001

# Discussion

increasingly attributed to dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, leading to immune dysfunction and the onset of the disease [37, 38]. While extensive research has identified the
