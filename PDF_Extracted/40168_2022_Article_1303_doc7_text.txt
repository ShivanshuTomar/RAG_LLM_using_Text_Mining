A total of 93 metabolites were significantly different in Y-DSS pigs compared with Y-CON pigs, including 31 upregulated and 62 downregulated metabolites (Fig. 5c).

Interestingly, the Venn diagram revealed 10 differential metabolites in common between the two comparisons (M-CON vs. M-DSS, Y-CON vs. Y-DSS) (Fig. 6a). Nine of the common differential metabolites showed the same trends between control and diseased individuals of the two breeds; the remaining metabolite, anileridine, showed opposing directions. Anileridine was significantly higher in M-DSS pigs but significantly lower in Y-DSS pigs than in the corresponding controls (Fig. 6b).

To determine the functions of the altered metabolites, we performed KEGG enrichment analysis (Fig. 6c and d), and the results were in basic agreement with the microbiome functions. The common pathways enriched in comparisons of M-CON vs. M-DSS and Y-CON vs. Y-DSS included linoleic acid metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, glutathione metabolism and beta-alanine metabolism. Notably, the significantly altered metabolites related to beta-alanine metabolism exhibited opposing trends of change between the two breeds. These metabolites increased in M-DSS pigs, indicating activation of this pathway but decreased in Y-DSS pigs.

The specific pathways enriched in M-DSS pigs compared with M-CON pigs were arginine biosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism and biosynthesis of antibiotics. Specifically, we found that some intermediate metabolites involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics, such as ornithine, L-citrulline and L-tryptophan, were significantly increased in M-DSS pigs. All significantly altered metabolites involved in tryptophan metabolism were upregulated in M-DSS pigs (Fig. 6e), suggesting that the metabolome of Min pigs may undergo a superior adaptive adjustment by increasing the accessibility of tryptophan to the host.

The specific pathways enriched in Y-DSS pigs compared with Y-CON pigs were sphingolipid metabolism, nitrotoluene degradation and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. The major intermediate metabolites involved in these pathways, such as spermidine, sphingosine and acetic acid, were downregulated in Y-DSS pigs compared with Y-CON pigs (Fig. 6e).

In addition to the relative concentrations of colonic small molecules that were identified by metabolomics, the absolute concentrations of the total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, isobutyrate and isovalerate were quantified (Fig. 6f). Acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate and isovalerate were significantly higher in M-DSS pigs than in M-CON pigs (P < 0.05) but lower in Y-DSS pigs than in Y-CON pigs, potentially indicating a relatively lower self-adjustment capacity of Yorkshire pigs during acute colitis.

Spearman’s correlation coefficient (R > 0.50, P < 0.05) assessed the correlation between the colonic microbiota and metabolites. In Min pigs (Supplementary Fig. 3a), positive correlations were observed mainly between potentially beneficial microbes Lactobacillus, Eubacterium, Blautia, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_002 and Christensenellaceae and acetate, L-tryptophan, butyrate, benzoic acid and anileridine (0.58 < R < 0.93, P < 0.05). These microbiota and metabolites are involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids, biosynthesis of antibiotics, linoleic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism and tryptophan metabolism. The Spearman’s rank correlation network showed that potentially beneficial microbes might assist in metabolite recovery and support normal gut function (Supplementary Fig. 3c).

In Yorkshire pigs (Supplementary Fig. 3b), negative correlations mainly existed between potentially harmful microbes Veillonella, Alistipes, Bacteroides, Bilophila and Desulfovibrio and fatty acyls, phenols, imidazopyridine, isoflavonoids, sterol lipids, carboxylic acids and derivatives (0.58 < R < 0.96, P < 0.05), which are involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, butanoate metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, secondary bile acid biosynthesis and beta-alanine metabolism. The correlation network was built from the Spearman’s nonparametric rank correlation coefficient between microbiota and the above metabotypes (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Potentially harmful microbes were negatively correlated with most of the above metabotypes, including metabolites such as N8-acetylspermidine, spermidine, 12-ketodeoxycholic acid, nutriacholic acid, reserpic acid, kanzonol and valerate. These data suggested that the changes in microbes in Yorkshire pigs were associated with metabolic dyshomeostasis and interfered with normal intestinal function.

# Gut barrier function responds differently to DSS treatment between Min and Yorkshire pigs

Gut barrier function comprises three major parts: a mechanical barrier, an ecological barrier and an immunological barrier [23]. Disorganisation of the ecological barrier (microbial dysbiosis) often leads to dysfunction of the mechanical barrier and immunological barrier.
