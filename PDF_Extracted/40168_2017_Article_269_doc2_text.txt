# SourceTracker analysis

To assess the proportion of pre-transplant communities that were retained in the patients’ microbiota, we used SourceTracker [23]. The pre-transplant samples and the donor samples were described as sources; all the other samples were used as sinks. For all samples at days 7 and 28, SourceTracker estimated the proportion of communities that were attributed to 1 of 3 environments, (1) the donor, (2) the patient pre-transplant, and (3) unknown community. Using these proportions, we grouped the samples according to their IBD status and compared their distributions using the Mann-Whitney test (as implemented in SciPy 0.15.1 [24]).

# Clinical statistics

Statistical analyses for clinical data were performed with JMP version 11.0 (SAS institute, NC). Data analysis included descriptive statistics, t tests for normally distributed variables, non-parametric tests for skewed variables, chi-square tests, and ANOVA tests as applicable. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

# Results

# FMT leads to resolution of CDI

In order to assess gut microbiota changes following FMT, 38 patients with recurrent CDI were enrolled in the study and a fecal sample was obtained prior to transplant, as well as 7 and 28 days post-transplant. Sample handling, donor and recipient sample collection, sample processing, and data analyses are detailed in supplementary methods. FMT was accomplished by colonoscopy using fresh donor stools from related (n = 12) or unrelated (n = 26) donors. None of the IBD patients received stool from a related donor. The demographic, disease, and treatment characteristics are outlined in Table 1. Detailed characteristics of IBD patients are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. Twelve patients (31.6%) had IBD (6 with UC and 6 with Crohn’s disease), with median age 27.6 years (range 23.3–74.9), and median IBD duration 5 years (range 2–33). 58.3% of patients were on 5-ASA (amino salicylic acid) agents, 50% on biologics, 33.3% on immunomodulators, and 58.3% on steroids. Among patients with IBD, at the time of colonoscopy, 2 had normal colonoscopy, 1 had pseudopolyps, 5 had severe pancolitis, 1 had moderate colitis, 1 had mild colitis, 1 had mild procto-sigmoiditis, and 1 had moderate ileocolitis (Additional file 1: Table S1).

All patients responded to FMT with regards to clinical or microbiologic remission of CDI (negative C. difficile testing in the presence of ongoing diarrhea), 92.1% (n = 35) of patient symptoms returned to baseline bowel pattern (as before CDI) and resolution of CDI, 5.3% (n = 2, both with IBD) had worsening diarrhea (C. difficile negative), and 2.6% (n = 1) had new onset constipation after FMT. Upon long-term follow-up of 24 months; 13.2% (n = 5/38; of these, n = 1 within 56 days, n = 1 from
