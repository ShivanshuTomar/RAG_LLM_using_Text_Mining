|Moayyedi 2015|UC|MiSeq Illumina|Not reported|Beta diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) was calculated using the Phyloseq R package.|Relative abundance and taxonomic profiles were computed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology.|The study authors sequenced the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene using MiSeq Illumina technology. QIIME and the Phyloseq R package was used for curation of data and in-depth microbiota analyses. This study compared the microbiota of several different donors. Moreover, the authors compared the microbiota of FMT recipients during the time course of the study following FMT. Finally, responders and non-responders microbiota were compared.
