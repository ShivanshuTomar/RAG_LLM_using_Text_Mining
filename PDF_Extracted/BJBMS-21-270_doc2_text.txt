# A HEALTHY MICROBIOME

Although indigenous microbiota are now recognized as an important aspect of human health, the phylogenetic and functional composition of a healthy microbiome has yet to be precisely identified [28]. Healthy microbial patterns have not been conclusively documented and functional descriptions of healthy microbiota are less clear than disease-associated microbial patterns. While there is agreement that microorganisms, particularly bacteria, play an important role in health and disease, no clear causal relationships have been established [28]. Perhaps the best description of a healthy microbiome is the ecological stability of microbial patterning on or in the body habitat or body sites. Hence, preserving the resilience of bacterial populations to ecologic stress or perturbation may be an important consideration. The persistent variation found in microbiota between individuals suggests that the idea of defining a healthy microbiome as a specific collection of bacterial species within a community is too simplistic. An alternative concept of a healthy microbiome would describe functional genes and the presence of metabolic pathways [28]; this would better explain the differences in and between healthy and unhealthy people.

In healthy states and under normal circumstances, microbes within the GI tract perform beneficial functions for the human host. The GI environment supports the growth, reproduction, and longevity of the microbial community [29]. In adulthood, when the composition of the GI microbiota is assumed to be diverse and stable, a large variety of microbes, comprising over 1000 different bacterial species coexist. Among these, four dominant bacterial phyla have been identified via molecular-dependent methods: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Protobacteria, and Actinobacteria [30,31].

In addition to bacteria, the GI microbiota include archaea, in particular Methanobrevibacter smithii, found in almost 96% of healthy individuals; these produce methane from the hydrogen generated by bacterial catabolism [32]. Furthermore, fungi, such as members of the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, are also an important portion of the human GI microbiota [33]. Saccharomyces, Candida, and Cladosporium are human-associated fungal genera that include several low-abundance strains. Notably, M. smithii, Saccharomyces, and Candida are frequently found together in individuals that have carbohydrate-rich diets [33]. Even though Candida is considered part of the normal flora and can remain non-pathogenic in many individuals, the usage of antibiotics or immunosuppressants can encourage outgrowth and niche-specific invasion by this genus throughout host tissues and mucosa [33].

There are complex interaction networks among the main microbial phyla present in the gut, which reflect the range of dynamic exchanges needed for a physiological microbiota-host balance [34]. Analysis of the human microbiome by the Human Microbiome Project has revealed that, besides the most dominant phyla (Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes), there is a large degree of variation in the relative composition of healthy microbiota, both in phylum-genus distributions and in terms of individual differences, that were initially grouped into different enterotypes [35].

Generally, the mammalian immune system has complicated dynamic bidirectional interactions with the host-associated microbiota. Although recent studies suggest that most immune responses are derived from stimulation of the host genome, almost 10% of immune responses are stimulated by direct interaction with the host microbiome [36,37].

There has been significant debate regarding the temporal stability of the microbiota in healthy individuals, since many factors affect it (e.g., environment [38], travel [39], interactions with other humans or pets [40], diet [41], antibiotics [42], and tobacco use [43]). Also, the rate of change of the composition of microbial populations varies between individuals [44]. As such, it is important to emphasize that there is no general formula for a healthy microbiota that reflects microbial functional redundancy across microbiota-host relationships.

# DYNAMICS OF THE HUMAN MICROBIOME

In 2005, human health was defined by Bircher et al. as “a dynamic state of well-being characterized by a physical, mental, and social potential, which satisfies the demands of life commensurate with age, culture, and personal responsibility” [28,45]. Therefore, the dynamics of the microbiota in response to interactions with other humans, with other non-human creatures, or with the surrounding environment should be taken into consideration when studying the healthy microbiome. Studies investigating the role of the microbiome in human health monitored the dynamics of the changes that occur in microbial communities, demonstrating both plasticity and stability in the human microbiome [21,46]. In these studies, samples (of oral, skin, and GI microbiota) were collected daily from two individuals over the periods of 6 and 15 months. Only a fraction of microbial taxa was persistently present across all (or most) samples from the donor.
