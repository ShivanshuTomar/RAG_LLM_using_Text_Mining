This provides empirical evidence for MMUPHin’s effectiveness in real-world settings, in addition to its accuracy as quantified by our simulation studies.

# Consistent IBD microbial population structure discovered by unsupervised analysis

The existence of subtypes within gut microbial communities has been a major open question in human microbiome studies, and it is of particular importance within IBD as a potential explanation for heterogeneity in disease etiology and treatment response [6, 9]. To systematically characterize population structure in the IBD gut microbiome that was reproducible among studies, we performed both discrete (MMUPHin_Discrete) and continuous (MMUPHin_Continuous) structure discovery on the 10 cohorts using our meta-analysis framework. To identify potential discrete community types (i.e., clusters), we performed clustering analysis within each cohort’s IBD patient population and evaluated the clustering strength via prediction strength (MMUPHin_Discrete, “Methods”). We found no evidence to support discrete clustering structure within individual cohorts, nor were we able to reproduce each cohort’s clustering results externally (Fig. 5a). This lack of discrete structure was consistent when we further stratified samples to either CD or UC populations (Additional file 1: Fig. S13), or extended to additional dissimilarity metric and clustering strength measurements (Additional file 1: Fig. S13, “Methods”). Our observation that the IBD gut microbiome cannot be well characterized by discrete clusters is thus consistent with previous findings on gut microbial heterogeneity for healthy populations [41] and suggests that, at the level powered by this study, such microbiome subtypes are not clearly responsible for clinical heterogeneity.

Conversely, we identified two consistent, continuously varying gradients of microbial community variation in the IBD microbiome (Fig. 5b–d, Additional file 1: Fig. S14). These gradients represent patterns of microbes that occur with greater or lesser abundance in tandem, and which covary across subjects in a population; they were identified as principal component (PC) vectors that recur among different cohorts (MMUPHin_Continuous, see “Methods”) [35]. Briefly, we used the four largest IBD cohorts (CS-PRISM, Pouchitis, PROTECT, and RISK) as training datasets to identify two clusters of consistent PCs (Fig. 5b), which were confirmed with sensitivity analysis (Additional file 1: Fig. S15) and validated in the remaining cohorts (Additional file 1: Fig. S16). The consensus loadings (i.e., within-cluster average) representing these two clusters (Fig. 5c, Additional file 1: Fig. S14, Additional file 9: Table S7) were used to assign continuously varying scores to the IBD population that capture gradient changes in the microbiome that occurred consistently within IBD, across diseases, sample types, and cohorts. This disease-linked “type” of microbiome variation corresponded roughly to severity or extent of inflammation, as detailed below.

In particular, while the second continuous population structure captured the Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes tradeoff present in most gut microbiome studies (Additional file 1: Fig. S14) [9, 32, 41], the first continuous score was IBD-specific and corresponded roughly to more extreme disease-associated dysbiosis in CD and UC populations (Fig. 5d). This is evidenced by the taxa with highest weights in the scores’ consensus loading vector (Fig. 5c), which included taxa differentially abundant between IBD and control populations (Fig. 3). The score was consistent both within CD and UC while also further differentiating IBD, non-IBD control, and healthy populations (Fig. 5d).
