were not randomly identified. Among these 139 IBD-associated markers, 39 were IBD-enriched vOTUs, representing members of the Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Microviridae families, as well as unclassified viruses (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the majority of control-enriched vOTUs (89 out of 100) were from unknown families, with a few originating from the Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, Quimbyviridae, and crAss-like families.

To investigate the prokaryotic hosts infected by these viral markers associated with IBD, we performed virus-host prediction based on the comprehensive Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection containing 4644 gut prokaryotes [31] (see “Methods” for details). Approximately, 80% of the viral markers (112/139) were assigned to at least one prokaryotic host, with these hosts primarily belonging to the Bacteroidota, Firmicutes_A, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria phyla (Supplementary Fig. 5). A notable difference in host preference was observed between IBD- and control-enriched vOTUs (Fig. 3b). For instance, IBD-enriched vOTUs frequently include genera containing common bacterial pathogens, such as Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus. Moreover, the genus Veillonella, which was identified as an IBD-enriched bacteria in previous studies [32], was also infected by IBD-enriched vOTUs. In contrast, there was a high percentage of control-enriched vOTUs with predicted hosts (54%) infected with species from Bacteroidota, particularly Prevotella species, with most of these vOTUs lacking annotations from known viral families. A few control-enriched vOTUs were predicted to infect species from Ruminococcus_E and Faecalibacterium.

Furthermore, we conducted a functional comparison between IBD- and control-enriched vOTUs. Gene prediction of these vOTUs resulted in 8466 protein-coding genes, 49.2% of which were annotated as functional orthologs within the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Pfam databases [33, 34], spanning 1747 functional families. PCoA and PERMANOVA revealed a significant difference in the functional profiles between IBD-enriched and control-enriched vOTUs (PERMANOVA p < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 6). Using Fisher’s exact test with Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment, we identified 35 functional families that significantly differed in the occurrence rate between IBD-enriched and control-enriched vOTUs (q < 0.05; Fig. 3c). Functions related to viral structure proteins, particularly those involved in phage tail assembly (n = 6), were notably prevalent in IBD-enriched vOTUs but largely absent in control-enriched vOTUs. This suggests that the control-enriched vOTUs were more likely to belong to non-tailed phages. Moreover, four lysis proteins (PF06114.14, PF09682.11, PF05382.14, and PF16775.6), which interfere with the growth of host bacteria, were also found to be more commonly present in IBD-enriched vOTUs. Conversely, control-enriched vOTUs more frequently encoded genes associated with genetic information processing, indicating a greater focus on genetic replication and expression. Notably, more than 1/3 of the control-enriched vOTUs possessed the reverse transcriptase gene (K00986). These viruses were not annotated as Retroviridae, which predominantly infect human and animal vertebrates but were more likely to infect members of Bacteroidota. Numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of reverse transcriptase homologous genes in bacterial genomes, known as retrons, which function as components of the bacterial defense system against phages [35, 36]. Interestingly, we observed that, in addition to carrying the reverse transcriptase gene, several control-enriched vOTUs also contained typical viral protein sequences such as capsid and tape measure proteins (Supplementary Fig. 7). This suggests that these reverse transcriptase genes may not originate from host bacterial genomes but rather from the phages infecting them.

# The IBD viral signatures are consistent across global cohorts

To assess the reliability and consistency of the 139 IBD-associated vOTUs identified in this study, we validated them in publicly available IBD cohorts from diverse geographic origins. We collected 1171 gut VLP and bulk metagenomic sequencing samples from 9 case–control datasets, including data from the USA, Europe, and China (Supplementary Table 5). We processed these samples by filtering out low-quality and human reads, mapping them to our integrated gut virus catalog containing 10,054 vOTUs, and calculating the relative abundance of each vOTU. PCoA revealed a substantial difference in viral composition between IBD patients and healthy controls among all samples from the 11 datasets (including the 9 public datasets and the VLP and bulk datasets from this study) (PERMANOVA p < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 8), indicating the presence of common signatures in different populations. We then examined the direction of enrichment in the relative abundance of the 139 IBD-associated vOTUs between IBD patients and healthy controls in each cohort. Impressively, the direction of enrichment of these vOTUs displayed remarkable consistency across cohorts (average consistency rate of 70.0 ± 10.4% among the nine public datasets), despite a few exceptions in individual cohorts (Fig. 4a). This finding underscores the robustness of the IBD-associated vOTUs identified in this study in other public databases.

We built random forest (RF) models using the 139 IBD-associated vOTUs to evaluate their potential for classifying IBD patients from healthy controls in each
