- History of surgery (total colectomy, presence of stoma or ileo-anal pouch)

# Interventions

# Experimental arm

- "Super-donor" FMT via sigmoidoscopy at baseline, then "rectal instillation" at weeks 1–3

# Control arm

- Autologous FMT via sigmoidoscopy at baseline, then "rectal instillation" at weeks 1–3

# Outcomes

# Primary outcomes

- Steroid-free clinical remission at week 8 (total Mayo score ≤ 2, with all Mayo subscores ≤ 1)
- Steroid-free endoscopic remission or response at week 8 (≥ 1-point reduction from baseline in endoscopy subscore)

# Secondary outcomes

- Changes in calprotectin and CRP before and after FMT at week 8
- Steroid-free clinical remission at week 8 (combined Mayo subscores of ≤ 1 for Rectal Bleeding + Stool Frequency)
- Steroid-free clinical response at week 8 (Mayo score decrease ≥ 3 points, ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in combined Rectal Bleeding + Stool Frequency Mayo subscores, or both)
- Steroid-free endoscopic response at week 8 (Mayo Endoscopic subscore ≤ 1, with reduction ≥ 1 point from baseline)
- Steroid-free endoscopic remission at week 8 (Mayo Endoscopic subscore 0 or 1)
