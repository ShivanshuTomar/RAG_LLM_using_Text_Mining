# Aligning protein-coding genes against RefSeq genomes

The alignment of individual protein-coding genes against the RefSeq collection of genomes in NCBI was executed using the Docker image hosted at quay.io/fhcrc-microbiome/docker-diamond:v0.9.23—0 and built using the Dockerfile hosted at https://github.com/FredHutch/docker-diamond, running DIAMOND v0.9.23. The complete list of Prokaryotic RefSeq genomes was downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse#!/prokaryotes/ and the query proteins were aligned via DIAMOND against the annotated protein-coding sequences from each genome individually. We implemented this analysis on the Amazon Web Service using the Batch API for execution and resource management.

# Quantification of co-abundant genes in uncultured single cells

Datasets from published single-cell sequencing microbiome experiments [20] were downloaded and split by 10 × barcode (each corresponding to a single cell). The WGS data for each single cell was aligned against each reference gene catalog (for the CRC and IBD datasets) and filtered with FAMLI as described in workflow step 5 above. The result of this analysis was a count of the number of genes that were found in the same cell as another gene that is also part of the same CAG. As a comparison, we calculated the number of such genes that would be found with a randomly permuted set of CAG assignments.

- Additional file 1: Figure S1. The distribution of CAG size (genes per CAG; A and B) and the functional annotation of genes in CAGs is shown by CAG size (C and D). Each gene can be annotated with a range of biological functions, and the proportion of CAGs of a given size containing at least one functional annotation is shown (C and D). The CAGs generated from the CRC datasets are shown in A and C, while the CAGs generated from the IBD datasets are shown in B and D. The horizontal axis is shared between panels A and C, as well as B and D. (PDF 857 kb)
- Additional file 2: Figure S2. Single-cell microbiome datasets were analyzed using the gene catalogs and CAG groupings from the CRC and IBD datasets. Co-occurrence was measured as the number of genes that were found in the same cell with another gene from the same CAG. Simulations were performed by random permutation, with 1000 replicates. Orange bars show mean and standard deviation. (PDF 288 kb)
