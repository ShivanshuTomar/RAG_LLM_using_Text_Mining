# Correlation networks of uncommon metagenomic pathways

Figure 4. Correlation networks of uncommon metagenomic pathways in (a) NI subjects, (b) CD subjects, (c) UC subjects. The nodes encircled show the position of B. fragilis and other species like E. coli and V. parvula. The legend remarks the species of each node/pathway, where the grey nodes are classified as ’other’.

# Discussion

In the literature, the reduction of F. prausnitzii has been associated with IBD 33; nevertheless, in our results, we recognized that instead of a decrease in the quantity of F. prausnitzii pathways expressed, there was a change in the wiring in the metagenomic network. In particular, what changed from the NI correlation network and the IBD correlation networks were the bridge pathways connecting the module of unclassified pathways and the module containing the F. prausnitzii pathways. For instance, in the NI correlation network, the bridge pathway was node PWY-6527|UNCLASSIFIED, whereas, in the IBD networks, the bridge pathways between the two modules were node COA-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED. The correlation between these bridge nodes and the nodes in the aforementioned modules meant that both modules relied on that specific pathway to function correctly. On the one hand, the central substance was the tetrasaccharide stachyose which is degraded into UDP-alpha-D-glucose and has been recognized as a potential probiotic against enterotoxigenic E. coli 34; on the other hand, there was coenzyme A, which has a fundamental role in the metabolism and, in particular, is important in the oxidation of fatty acids. Several studies linked the alteration of fatty acid production to the IBDs; hence, this change in the centrality of the pathway related to this substance could be investigated further to explain the origins of IBDs 34. The modules of Bacteroides in IBD networks corresponded to the single species, whilst in the NI network are gathered in one module. This could demonstrate that in IBDs the different Bacteroides species proliferates the gut independently. by 35, which showed that lower levels of Bacteroides were associated with IBDs. Other pathways differentially wired between NI and IBD networks are those involving the bacterial metabolite 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (nodes PWY-6121|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII, PWY-6122|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII, PWY-6277|FAECALIBACTERIUM_PRAUSNITZII). These nodes were behaving as bridges in the NI correlation network; by contrast, in the IBD correlation networks, they were substituted by a unique bridge node (node COA-PWY|UNCLASSIFIED). In the range of uncommon bacterial species, we can observe the E. coli module; in the literature, this bacterial species has a recognized role in the development of IBD 36,37. It was possible to observe the different interplay between E. coli, V. parvula and B. fragilis across the different diagnoses. The increase of E. coli and B. fragilis in IBD was observed in a previous study 38, but our results provide additional information about the differential wiring scheme of the aforementioned species. In particular, it seemed that V. parvula pathways mediated the connection of E. coli with the other module in the correlation network. In particular, in the NI correlation network, V. parvula pathways were in the same module of B. fragilis pathways which were connected to the rest of the correlation network. In the CD correlation network, V. parvula pathways were included in the E. coli module, to remark how close the two bacterial species were, but if, on the one hand, the relationship between E. coli and B. fragilis has been already studied, the effect of V. parvula on E. coli has to be investigated yet in the literature. In the UC correlation network, V. parvula formed an almost completely isolated module far from the E. coli.
