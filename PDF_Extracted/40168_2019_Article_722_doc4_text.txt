We therefore investigated the gene-level richness, finding a lower level of gene richness observed in IBD samples compared to healthy controls (Additional file 3: Figure S3) [21], corroborating previous observations of lower alpha diversity in IBD [22, 23]. Without our use of the centered log-ratio to adjust for the compositional nature of these datasets, the decreased abundance of a large fraction of the microbiome may have resulted in a spurious finding that the remainder had increased in abundance [24], but in fact, we found that very few CAGs were consistently increased in abundance in IBD relative to the geometric mean of each sample. In addition to the decrease of overall gene richness, the lower number of CAGs found to be consistently enriched in IBD may also be due to an overall heterogeneity or ‘dispersion’ in the organisms which are positively associated with IBD across different people at a given point in time [14, 25]. However, there was a subset of CAGs which were consistently found to be more abundant in IBD, which may represent those bacteria which are able to thrive in the environment of the inflamed gut. Indeed, the taxonomic annotation of the genes in these CAGs is enriched for organisms which have been implicated in some previous studies of IBD and gut pathogens, including Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia/Shigella and Salmonella [3, 22, 23] which may exhibit some growth advantage in the context of either the increased oxygen content of the inflamed intestine or the antibiotics used in IBD treatment [9, 10]. Other organisms, such as Ruminococcus gnavus, were only enriched in IBD for a subset of genes (n = 77), supporting the previous hypothesis of a strain-specific association with IBD [4]. There was also a set of KEGG annotations that were weakly but consistently enriched in this set of IBD-associated genes related to colonization and pathogenesis, such as fimbriae genes fimA (K07345) and fimD (K07347), iron transport (K02010), and putrescine transport (K02052; K11072; K11076).

The pattern of association for the CRC datasets was generally balanced between CAGs that were more abundant in healthy participants and those that were more abundant in disease (Fig. 2a) Additional file 4: Table S1. Of the largest CAGs that were reproducibly associated with disease, those which were more abundant in healthy participants tended to be classified as Clostridia (via alignment to NCBI RefSeq), while those which were more abundant in participants with CRC were more taxonomically diverse (Fig. 3a, b). Moreover, we found the functional annotations of the genes in those CAGs to be particularly interesting. There were four KEGG annotations that were significantly enriched in the set of CAGs found to be more abundant in CRC samples (Fisher’s exact test, Holm-Sidak alpha = 0.01): (1) grdA (K10670) is involved in metabolism of glycine/sarcosine/betaine, and higher levels of glycine is a recognized hallmark of cancer cells [26, 27]; (2) oxyR (K04761) is a transcriptional regulator which regulates genes protecting from the biochemical damage induced by reactive oxygen species, of which markedly higher levels are associated with progressive tumors [28, 29]; (3) abgT (K12942) is a transporter responsible for uptake of p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate and may also import other dipeptides [30]; and (4) afuA/fbpA (K02012) are transporters responsible for importing iron [31], which is likely to be more abundant in the gastrointestinal lumen of individuals with CRC due to bleeding. Three of these four annotated functions have clear links to the altered environment of the gut microbiome expected during CRC and likely promote the growth of these organisms in that setting. It remains to be seen whether those organisms which are able to thrive in the CRC gut microbiome also contribute to the progression of disease (Additional file 4).

One advantage of a gene-based approach to metagenomic analysis is that any CAG of interest can be directly compared with the genomes of bacterial isolates in order to identify strains containing each gene. Of the set of genes that we identified as consistently associated with CRC and IBD, we found a number of strains containing large fractions of these genes (Fig. 3c, d). We furthermore propose that this approach of aligning disease-associated genes to whole microbial genomes may be used to identify the members of any culture collection which are likely to have the largest effect in an experimental model of these human diseases (Additional file 5).

# Conclusions

Having identified microbial protein-coding genes that are associated with CRC and IBD, we anticipate that other researchers may build on these findings in multiple ways. Researchers may compare this list of disease-associated genes to any genomes of interest in order to identify specific isolates and/or genes which may be perturbed in a controlled experimental setting to test the effect of microbes on host disease. Additionally, researchers may apply this general approach (quantification of CAGs from a de novo gene catalog) to their own metagenomic datasets in order to identify additional genes associated with any outcome of interest. While latter use-case may be implemented using the computational tools and associated Docker images described in the “Methods” section, we are hoping to further support this methodological approach by developing reproducible analytical workflows that are more easily executed by the general microbiome research community.

By proposing an approach to the analysis of metagenomic data that produces consistent results across multiple heterogeneous datasets, we are addressing one of the most important challenges in metagenomics, namely, reproducibility. Our findings suggest that indeed, co-
