# Fig. 1 A method for large-scale microbial community meta-analysis and its application to inflammatory bowel disease.

a We developed a novel statistical framework, MMUPHin, allowing joint normalization and meta-analysis of large microbial community profile collections with heterogeneous and complex designs (multiple covariates, longitudinal samples, etc.). We applied it to a collection of 10 inflammatory bowel disease studies comprising 2179 subjects and 5151 total samples (Table 1). We uniformly processed the associated sequence data and harmonized metadata across cohorts. Microbial taxonomic profiles were then corrected for batch and study effects before downstream analyses for omnibus and per-feature association with disease phenotypes and unsupervised population structure discovery.

b MDS ordination of all microbial profiles (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) before batch correction visualize the strongest associations with gut microbial composition, including disease, sample type (biopsy or stool), cohort (visualized separately for larger and smaller studies), and dominant phyla.

Using this joint dataset and upon uniform bioinformatics processing (“Methods”), we first assessed the factors that corresponded to overall variation in microbiome structure, which included disease status, sample type (biopsy versus stool), and dominant phyla (Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, Fig. 1b). Cohort effects prior to batch correction and meta-analysis were also significant. Microbiome differences associated with disease were notable even without normalization. However, this can be misleading due to the confounding of cohort structure between studies, such as the differentiation between RISK (a predominantly mucosal study of CD) and PROTECT (a predominantly stool study of UC). Inter-individual differences largely independent of population or disease, such as Bacteroidetes versus Firmicutes dominance, were also universal among studies and sample types as expected [9, 32]. Many of these factors were of comparable effect size, both visually and as quantified below, emphasizing the need for covariate-adjusted statistical modelling to delineate the biological (disease, treatment) and technical (cohort, batch) effects associated with individual taxa throughout the cohorts (Additional file 1: Figs. S1-S4, Additional file 2: Supplemental Notes).

# A statistical framework for meta‑analysis of microbial community profiles

We developed a collection of novel methods for meta-analysis of environmental exposures, phenotypes, and population structures across microbial community studies, specifically accounting for technical batch effects and interstudy differences (“Methods,” Fig. 1a). Jointly named MMUPHin (Meta-Analysis Methods with a Uniform Pipeline for Heterogeneity in microbiome studies), our methods consist of three main components: batch and study effect correction (MMUPHin_Correct), meta-analyzed.
