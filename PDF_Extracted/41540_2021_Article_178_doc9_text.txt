# Statistical analysis

Wilcoxon rank sum test, and correction for false discovery rate (FDR) were performed in MATLAB using the ranksum and mafdr functions, respectively. Correlations between computed fluxes and species abundances were calculated using a dedicated Microbiome Modelling Toolbox function (correlateFluxWithTaxonAbundance.m).

The number of secreted metabolites was calculated from the computed net production fluxes (Supplementary Table 2). The association between study group and number of secreted metabolites was assessed in linear regression (ordinary least squares), introducing the log number of species as covariate. For investigating the functional dependence of the number of secreted metabolites fractional polynomials were used. A logarithmic dependency showed a significant better fit (p < 0.01) than a linear function and was therefore used. Next, we tested the secretion (binary: yes vs. no) on association with the study group using Fisher’s exact tests controlling for the FDR as before. The number of tests to control for was determined by counting the number of independent dichotomised secretions.

In a third step, we counted the number of sulfur-containing metabolites independently secreted for each microbiome. We tested this number on association with the study group in linear regressions. Furthermore, we explored the classification of healthy microbiomes vs. dysbiotic IBD microbiomes in logistic regression by the number and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) as metric of classification accuracy. Then, we analysed the pattern of final breakdown products of sulfur metabolism (hydrogen, sulfide, sulfate, methanethiol, sulfite, and thiosulfate) across the three study groups via Fisher’s exact test. Finally, we checked whether the presence of any glycan-degrading species statistically mediated the effects of the study group variable via the Sobel Goodman test, deriving the confidence intervals by non-parametric bootstrapping with 1000 replications. These analyses were performed in STATA 14\MP (Stata Inc., College Station, USA).

# Random forests analysis

Random forests analysis was performed using the online implementation of MetaboAnalyst 5.031 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca), which relies on the MetaboAnalystR package. Briefly, the random forests classifier is built using a customisable number of trees with one-third of the data left out of the bootstrap sampling process. The left-out data is then used to estimate the out-of-bag (OOB) error. Metabolite secretion fluxes were imported through the Statistical Analysis module in the MetaboAnalyst interface without performing normalisation, transformation, or scaling of the data. The classifier was built with 5000 trees and the resulting visualisation of features ranked by their contributions to classification accuracy was exported.

# Visualisation

Phylum to amino acid and subsystem contributions were visualised using the online implementation of Circos (http://circos.ca). All other data was visualised in MATLAB version R2018b and in R version 3.5.3 (https://www.r-project.org).
