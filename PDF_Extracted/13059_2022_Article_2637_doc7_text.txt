enriched within the disease-associated ASVs (5/31 vs. 0/97 for disease- and health-associated ASVs respectively, chi-square p &lt; 0.001). To validate the use of the NRMD effect size calculation approach, we reanalyzed the same studies using two additional approaches: (i) rarifying each sample across all studies to 4000 reads/sample (Additional file 1: Fig. S2A, Additional file 2: dataset S1) and (ii) using the LEFSE [38] LDA score instead of the NRMD (Additional file 1: Fig. S2B and Additional file 2: Dataset S1). Those present similar results compared to the NRMD approach, with the mean effect size (i.e., higher, or lower in disease) showing similar direction for 31/31 of the disease-associated and 96/97 health-associated bacteria using the rarified data and 30/31 of the disease-associated and 95/97 health-associated bacteria using the LEFSE LDA score (see supplementary methods for details).

To infer microbial functions enriched in the health vs. disease-associated ASV bacteria, we applied Picrust2 [39] and identified 10 KEGG functions that were more common in disease, and 14 more common in controls (rank-mean test with dsFDR &lt; 0.1, Additional file 1: Fig. S3 and Additional file 3: Dataset S2). Functions enriched in disease associated ASVs included carbohydrate metabolism, whereas functions enriched in health associated ASVs included metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and amino acid metabolism. Interestingly, cellular community pathways and more specifically quorum sensing genes, were more common in disease associated ASVs process allowing bacterial populations to communicate and coordinate group behavior, a process which is more commonly used by pathogens [40].

# IBD‑specific microbial alteration is predominantly linked to increased abundance of individual taxa

We next searched for ASVs specifically associated with CD/UC. For that, the naïve approach of performing differential abundance on CD/UC samples compared to controls without considering the behavior in other disease cohorts does not suffice. We therefore defined CD/UC-specific ASVs as ASVs showing significantly higher or lower NRMD effect size in fecal samples from CD and UC disease cohorts (n = 10) compared to other non-IBD disease cohorts (n = 45) (using permutation-based rank mean test of the per-disease cohort NRMDs, with dsFDR = 0.1). Fifteen ASVs were significantly related to UC and CD, with 13 showing a higher NRMD between UC and CD cases and controls and 2 showing a decrease in NRMD between UC/CD and controls (Fig. 4A and Additional file 4: Dataset S3). Those specific CD and UC enriched ASVs included taxa from Gemellaceae, Veillonellaceae, Fusobacteriaceae, and Streptococcaceae families. Term enrichments of those 13 CD/UC-associated specific ASVs using dbBact database showed enrichment for microbial taxa seen in saliva samples (Fig. 4B), with more significant overlap with salivary samples in 2 additional studies (Fig. 4C). Attempts to find other disease-specific signals, including for Parkinson’s disease failed, likely due to lack of sufficient number of studies linked with a specific condition.

# Inaccuracy of classifier to differentiate between different disease states

Machine learning classifiers are commonly used to differentiate between healthy and disease cases [43]. However, the fact that a large set of bacteria display a consistent change across multiple disease raises the concern that classifiers may capture this shared
