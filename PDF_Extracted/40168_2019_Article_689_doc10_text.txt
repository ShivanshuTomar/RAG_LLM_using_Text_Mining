# Fig. 4 Metabolic bottlenecks and shadow price profiles computed when optimizing for Iso-CA production in 194 microbiome community models.

a Abundance of the 3β-HSDH reaction yielding Iso-CA (VMH ID: ICA3bHSDHe) plotted against Iso-CA production potential (flux values are given in mmol gDW−1 h−1) for the 194 microbiomes.

b Heat map of the shadow prices retrieved from the 194 microbiomes when the production of two deconjugated primary and 13 secondary bile acids was optimized. Blue and white data points show nonzero and zero shadow prices, respectively. The columns show the 194 microbiomes annotated by group. The rows show all metabolites that had a nonzero shadow price in at least one community model. The metabolites are annotated by taxonomy. Entries annotated with “Diet_metabolite” represent bile acid metabolites present in the dietary, luminal, or fecal compartment of the microbiome model. The “bile acid optimized” color bar shows the bile acid for which production was optimized.

c Number of metabolites with nonzero shadow prices in the microbiome models of healthy adults, IBD patients, and healthy pediatric controls. Significant difference (p value < 0.001) is indicated by stars.

d Shadow prices for the biomass metabolite of Holdemania filiformis DSM 12042, a strain carrying 3α-HSDH but not 3β-HSDH, plotted against Iso-CA production and abundance of the 3β-HSDH reaction. Blue dots indicate models belonging to Scenario 2.

e Shadow prices for the biomass metabolite of Collinsella aerofaciens ATCC 25986, a strain carrying 3β-HSDH but not 3α-HSDH, plotted against Iso-CA production and abundance of the 3β-HSDH reaction. Blue dots indicate models belonging to Scenario 3.

f Shadow prices for the biomass metabolite of Ruminococcus gnavus ATCC 29149, a strain carrying both 3α-HSDH and 3β-HSDH, plotted against Iso-CA production and abundance of the 3β-HSDH reaction.

For dietary exchange metabolites of the bile acids. Overall, 1138 microbial and dietary metabolites were found to be relevant for bile-acid synthesis in the entire set of microbiome models (Additional file 1: Table S10). When comparing the shadow prices in the three groups, the number of metabolites with nonzero shadow prices was significantly lower in the IBD microbiomes than either in the healthy pediatric or healthy adult microbiomes (Fig. 4c). Hence, the pediatric IBD patients were depleted in strains with bile acid biosynthesis capabilities. This result highlights that an increase in secondary bile acid biosynthesis in these individual communities could only be achieved by introducing additional microbial strains.

Next, we aimed to identify the factors limiting Iso-CA biosynthesis potential. Of the reconstructed strains, 16 and 11 strains, respectively, carried the 3α- and 3β-HSDH enzyme (Additional file 1: Table S1). Five strains (Eggerthella sp. 1_3_56FAA, Eggerthella lenta DSM 2243, Gordonibacter pamelaeae 7-10-1-bT, Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium ATCC 25291, and Ruminococcus gnavus ATCC 29149) possessed both enzymes. Of the strains possessing either or both enzymes, 18 were present in at least one of the 194 microbiome models. The shadow prices corresponding to Iso-CA production were inspected (Additional file 1: Table S10). Note that shadow prices for Iso-CDCA were analogous.

Four scenarios could be distinguished based on the shadow prices. Seven microbiomes belonging to the first scenario were unable to synthesize Iso-CA (Additional file 1: Table S6). Consequently, in these microbiomes, shadow prices were only nonzero for dietary Iso-CA (Additional file 1: Table S10) indicating that Iso-CA levels could only be increased by directly providing it. In the second scenario, which was found in 19 microbiomes, shadow prices for the six strains carrying 3β-HSDH but not 3α-HSDH were nonzero for at least one of the six strains’ biomass metabolites (Additional file 1: Table S10). In the same 19 microbiomes, shadow prices for all eight strains carrying 3α-HSDH but not 3β-HSDH were zero. This result showed that 3α-HSDH abundance was not a bottleneck and Iso-CA production could be increased by increasing the abundance of strains carrying 3β-HSDH. In these microbiomes the 3β-HSDH abundance directly correlated with Iso-CA production flux, as illustrated with the example of Holdemania filiformis DSM 12042 in Fig. 4d. In the third scenario, which contained the majority of microbiomes (145 cases), the shadow prices for all six strains carrying 3β-HSDH but no 3α-HSDH were zero. Instead, the shadow prices for at least one of the eight strains carrying 3α-HSDH but not 3β-HSDH were nonzero. Consequently, in these microbiomes, the availability of the precursor 3-dehydro-CA was flux-limiting and Iso-CA production could not be increased by increasing the abundance of strains carrying only 3β-HSDH. These 145 microbiomes had the lower than expected Iso-CA production potential (Fig. 4e). As expected, in all 145 microbiomes, the shadow price for dietary 3-dehydro-CA, the precursor of Iso-CA, was also nonzero (Additional file 1: Table S10). Finally, in the fourth scenario, which consisted of 22 microbiomes, shadow prices were nonzero only for the biomass metabolite of Ruminococcus gnavus ATCC 29149 and in some cases Eggerthella lenta DSM 2243 (Fig. 4f). These two strains possess both 3α-HSDH and 3β-HSDH and are present in most microbiomes in this study. Thus, they played a central role for all microbiomes’ capabilities to synthesize Iso-CA.

In summary, by analyzing the shadow prices associated with each flux balance analysis solution when optimizing for secondary bile acid production, strain-specific contributions to their biosynthesis were determined for each personalized community model. Four scenarios with different bottlenecks for the biosynthesis of Iso-CA were identified. This analysis highlights once more that the metabolic potential of an individual microbiome, and
