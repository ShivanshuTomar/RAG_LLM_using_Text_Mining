Previous studies in humans provided similar evidence that stress induces an increase of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines [119 – 121]. For instance, academic stress, referred to as the body’s response to academic-related workload that goes beyond the adaptive capabilities of students [122], was shown to significantly increase the production of interferon-gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) [119]. Acute stress can also upregulate anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL10, while independently inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα [123]. These effects can induce a shift towards Th2-mediated humoral response [124], which may be essential to prevent hyperactivation of the stress system. Alternatively, chronic stress is known to increase the release of cortisol levels for several days, an effect that may be associated with immunosuppression, as shown by a reduction in circulating CD8+ lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and macrophages [125]. Nevertheless, as chronic psychological stress was also associated with increased levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) [126], these data suggest that chronic stress may also exert pro-inflammatory effects. Obviously, it should be noted that the gastrointestinal tract per se, including its local microbiota, may serve as an essential organ mediating immune responses [127]. This is not only of relevance in the context of human IBD, but also in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [128] as well as major depressive disorders [129].

# 5.4. Stress and Inflammation in IBD

Inflammatory bowel disease is a complex disease that likely does not only consist of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Extensive translational research has been conducted to better understand the role of stress and inflammation in IBD [130].

# 5.4.1. Preclinical Studies

Previously, using rodent models of spontaneous colitis, it was shown that intestinal inflammation is associated with defects in mucosal barrier or dysfunctional regulatory T lymphocytes [131]. Other studies using mice fed a dextran–sulfate–sodium diet to induce colitis revealed the importance of intestinal adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1, in the development of intestinal inflammation [132]. Relevantly, when dextran–sulfate–sodium-treated mice were injected with enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, increased colitis and colonic inflammation was observed [133]. Similarly, in cellular models, Clostridium difficile toxin A was shown to induce apoptosis and inflammation in enterocytes [134, 135]. Moreover, using a mouse model of depression, it was shown that stress-induced release of corticosteroids can reactivate IBD [136], likely via increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These data imply that stress may affect the course of the disease.

# 5.4.2. Clinical Studies

In humans, it was shown that infections with Bacteroides fragilis, through secretion of its pro-inflammatory toxin, is associated with development of ulcerative colitis [137]. Likewise, infections with Clostridium difficile is thought to be involved in the reactivation of IBD in patients [138]. Within a similar context, it was also shown that patients with ileal Crohn’s disease had a higher percentage of invasive Escherichia coli in the mucosa as compared to healthy controls, and these percentages even correlated with severity of the disease [139]. In line, another study demonstrated that Escherichia coli can replicate inside macrophages of patients with Crohn’s disease and subsequently secrete large amounts of TNFα, thereby contributing to inflammation [140]. Collectively, these data point towards the strong relationship between the gut microbiota composition and intestinal inflammation.

It is also important to note that psychosocial stress, including psychological distress, anxiety, and depression, can induce low-grade chronic inflammation in the gut. For instance, in humans, it was shown that depression correlated with elevated levels of TNFα and CRP, pro-inflammatory cytokines that are known to trigger inflammation in patients with IBD [141, 142]. Hence, it has
