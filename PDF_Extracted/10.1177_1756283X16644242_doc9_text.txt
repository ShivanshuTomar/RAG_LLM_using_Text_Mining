have also been studied. The specific carbohydrate diet (SCD), an elimination diet which removes grains, milk, and sweeteners (except honey), has been shown in small case series to be effective for inducing and maintaining remission in CD [Cohen et al. 2014; Suskind et al. 2014; Kakodkar et al. 2015] and UC [Obih et al. 2016]. The mechanism by which the SCD works may come from alteration of the microbiome or barrier function via differences in macronutritients or removal of certain dietary exposures such as emulsifiers [Martinez-Medina et al. 2014; Chassaing et al. 2015; Nickerson et al. 2015]. Interestingly, the effect of EEN and SCD on the microbiota is divergent, with microbial diversity decreasing with EEN [Gerasimidis et al. 2014; Quince et al. 2015] and increasing with SCD [Walters et al. 2014]. Other diet therapies including individually tailored exclusion [Riordan et al. 1993], IgG4 targeted exclusion [Rajendran and Kumar, 2010], lacto-ovo-vegetarian fiber rich diet [Chiba et al. 2010] and low FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-di-monosaccharides and polyols) diet [Gearry et al. 2009] have reported primarily symptomatic improvement in patients with IBD.

# Barrier function based therapies

Restoring mucosal barrier integrity holds promise as a future treatment approach for IBD. It may indeed be a common denominator in all IBD therapies, including those that target the immune system or microbiota. As noted above, inhibition of TNFα and other inflammatory cytokines leads to improvement in barrier function. Remodeling the microbiota has also been shown to improve barrier function [Cani et al. 2009; Ulluwishewa et al. 2011], and exclusionary diets may improve barrier function via effects on the mucus layer [Martinez-Medina et al. 2014; Chassaing et al. 2015; Nickerson et al. 2015]. Even the mechanism of action of helminth therapies in which parasites are introduced to patients in a controlled fashion may be grounded in improving barrier function [Wolff et al. 2012].

Several drugs are known to act directly on restoring barrier function. A delayed release phosphatidylcholine, ‘LT-02’, recently completed phase II clinical trials for UC and is believed to work by helping restore the mucus layer [Stremmel et al. 2010; Karner et al. 2014]. Teduglutide is a glucagon-like 2 peptide analog that is indicated for the treatment of short gut syndrome [Jeppesen, 2012]. It has strong trophic effects on intestinal mucosa with restoration of the mucosal barrier and pilot studies have shown efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe CD [Buchman et al. 2010; Blonski et al. 2013].

Some supplements have also been investigated for their ability to improve tight junctions [Ulluwishewa et al. 2011]. The amino acid, L-glutamine, has been studied extensively in nutrition for critically ill patients and burn victims in which tight junction disruption is known to contribute to bacteremia [Wischmeyer, 2007; Bollhalder et al. 2013], although in patients in the intensive care unit with multiorgan failure, glutamine increased mortality [Heyland et al. 2013]. In vitro cell culture studies show a direct effect on improving tight junction function [Bertrand et al. 2015]. Only limited studies have been performed in treating active IBD with negative results [Akobeng et al. 2000; Ockenga et al. 2005], but further studies are being considered to investigate the role of L-glutamine in maintenance rather than induction of remission.

Natural products often used by alternative practitioners for the treatment of IBD have shown some efficacy and may also exert their effect via modulation of tight junctions [Gilardi et al. 2014]. Curcumin (turmeric extract) and boswellia have been shown to promote improvement in tight junctions in cell culture based assays [Wang et al. 2012; Catanzaro et al. 2015]. Other dietary components (macro- and micronutrients), in addition to the microbiota effects described above, may directly impact tight junctions in IBD [Ulluwishewa et al. 2011].

# Conclusion

The microbiome, barrier function, and immune system play an integrated role in the development of IBD, and all three components are likely critical for perpetuating the disease process. Genetic risk factors may be disproportionately responsible for immune system dysfunction, environmental risk factors may be disproportionately responsible for dysbiosis, and both factors likely contribute to barrier dysfunction. While currently available therapies targeting the immune system have made great strides in IBD therapy, many patients remain refractory to treatment. There is great promise in targeting the other two pathophysiological components of IBD, the microbiota and barrier function, as new primary or adjunctive therapies for IBD.
