# Metagenomics and IBD

Mean metagenomics is not reliable on tissues with low host–microbe biomass ratio, such as colon biopsies, where >95% of DNA sequenced is nonmicrobial.

Metataxonomic and metagenomic insights into IBD. Gut microbial taxonomic and functional profiling studies of stool and mucosal biopsies through NGS has provided us with a wealth of evidence that a dysfunctional gut microbiome plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IBD. There are consistent data demonstrating that patients with IBD have a decrease in the compositional diversity and stability largely due to a reduction in the phylum Firmicutes and an increase in Proteobacteria. Shifts in specific taxonomic classes have been consistently reported in IBD. Broadly, gut bacterial classification studies in IBD have identified depletions in bacteria with anti-inflammatory effects, including Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and other short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, along with a relative expansion in pathogenic bacteria, including such as adherent-invasive Escherichia coli. These compositional differences highlight potential mechanisms that contribute to the inflammatory mechanisms of disease in IBD. For example, in several landmark studies, reduced abundances of ileal mucosal F. prausnitzii are associated with a higher risk of recurrent CD after ileocaecal resection, and recovery of F. prausnitzii after a flare in UC is associated with maintenance of clinical remission. Metagenomic studies have further highlighted differences in the functional composition of the gut microbiota in IBD. Genes associated with butanoate and propanoate metabolism are decreased and this change is consistent with the reductions seen in SCFA-producing Firmicutes clades from studies profiling gut bacterial taxonomy. Furthermore, a decrease in genes associated with the biosynthesis of amino acids and an increase in amino acid transporters and metabolism of the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine is noted amongst many findings.

Metagenomics and metataxonomic studies (in conjunction with other microbial omics) highlight multiple potential pathways through which gut microbiota in IBD contribute to immune dysregulation, gut barrier breakdown and intestinal inflammation. There are significant inter-study discrepancies largely due to multiple confounding factors, such as tissue source (stool or mucosa), disease activity, medication, diet, age and differences in both wet and dry lab techniques. On its own, this microbial compositional and functional profiling in IBD has only demonstrated disease associations and potential mechanisms. We now need well designed studies in IBD that use metagenomics or metataxonomics as one part of the jigsaw in proving causative mechanisms and predicting or ameliorating disease.

# Metatranscriptomics

The recent emergence of highly parallel RNA-sequencing technologies has allowed us to gain insights into gene expression profiles of the host and microbial community. While metagenomics tells about the genomic potential of microbes in a community, metatranscriptomics informs us on the actual genetic activity within a community phenotype. The gut microbial transcriptional activity is determined by a multitude of factors such as changes in host health and disease state, immune micro-environment, diet and the microbial ecosystem. The metatranscriptome, therefore, is dynamic and contextualizes microbial functional activity to the host phenotype, and when used in conjunction with metagenomics provides a powerful understanding on the molecular mechanisms by which gut bacteria contribute to health and disease. It provides significant value in shifting our current descriptive gut microbiome knowledge towards a deeper understanding of host–microbial causal mechanisms in contributing to homeostasis and disease.

A metatranscriptome experiment involves isolation of total RNA from a tissue, such as colon biopsy or stool. This isolation can be followed by depletion of the host mRNA, for example, by using hybridization probes that take advantage of the poly-A tail on eukaryotic mRNA. In eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, approximately 80–90% of the total RNA is comprised of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 15% of transfer RNA (tRNA); protein-coding mRNA constitutes only 2–5% in a sample. Consequently, this makes depletion of both human and bacterial small and large rRNA an imperative step of any metatranscriptome experiment. Libraries of cDNA from the rRNA-depleted mRNA are generated followed by ligation to adapters before amplification and sequencing. Bioinformatic pipelines such as HumaNN2 and SAMSA2 can be used to process the generated reads, perform quality control assessment, and undertake removal in silico of any rRNA and host transcriptome contamination.
