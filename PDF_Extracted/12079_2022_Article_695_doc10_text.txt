# Role of interleukin-6-mediated inflammation in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease

can efficiently ameliorate the number of tumors and colon shortening in AOM/DSS-induced colitis. Molecular analysis disclosed that 3′-hydroxypterostilbene has anti-inflammatory properties because this compound significantly decreases the levels of IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Furthermore, dietary 3′-hydroxypterostilbene could markedly reduce IL-6/STAT3 signals in the inflamed colonic tissue (Lai et al. 2017).

Sesbania grandiflora is a herbal plant containing polyphenol, flavonoid, and flavanone with antitumor and anti-inflammatory characteristics used in treating UC. In this regard, an experimental investigation reported that the IL-6 and TNF-α levels were reduced following treatment with hydroalcoholic extract of Sesbania grandiflora in an acetic acid-induced UC mouse model (Gupta et al. 2018). This study claimed that 200 mg of hydroalcoholic extract of Sesbania grandiflora could be as effective as 2 mg of prednisolone. The presence of highly polymerized polyphenols and flavonoids, particularly quercetin, in this plant may be the reason for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities (Gupta et al. 2018).

Gegen Qinlian decoction (GQ) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine broadly utilized to treat enteric typhoid fever and bacterial dysentery. Recently, clinical studies have revealed that GQ could be a potential therapeutic option for UC treatment. Experimental investigations demonstrated that GQ significantly alleviated UC symptoms in DSS-induced mice models of UC and repressed myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Additionally, the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, and TGF-β1, as well as infiltration of Th17 and Treg cells into the colons, was reduced following administration of GQ. The findings also showed that phosphorylation of STAT3 and JAK2 was decreased after treatment (Zhao et al. 2021). Therefore, GQ can reduce the dysregulated inflammatory responses in the inflamed tissue of the colon by inhibiting IL-6/IL-6r/STAT3 axis signaling, which can be beneficial for treatment.

Another anti-inflammatory alkaloid compound found in the Boldo tree is Boldine. It has been reported that Boldine can decrease inflammatory-associated colon injury. The mechanism of this anti-inflammatory action has not yet been fully elucidated, but there is evidence of decreased TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17, pSTAT3, and p65 NFKB levels, as well as decreased inflammatory cell infiltration into colon tissue (Pandurangan et al. 2016). Pien Tze Huang (PZH) is a famous traditional Chinese formula used in inflammatory diseases. An investigation reported that PZH could noticeably alleviate DSS-induced colitis symptoms, such as stool consistency, rectal bleeding, and body weight loss. Furthermore, PZH could prevent DSS-induced colon shortening and improve colonic histopathological alterations, including crypt distortion, infiltration of immune cells, hyperplastic epithelium, and mucosal ulceration.

Moreover, PZH treatment pointedly repressed the DSS-induced expression of IL-6 in colon tissues and inhibited the IL-6/IL-6r/STAT3 signals (Li et al. 2018). An open-label, prospective phase 2a trial was conducted on patients with active IBD undertreatment with the olamkicept (a trans-signaling inhibitor) to block IL-6 trans-signaling in vivo. Findings showed that olamkicept significantly reduced phosphorylated STAT3 and noticeable transcriptional alterations in the inflamed mucosa. These data proposed that blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling could be a promising and novel strategy for treating IBD (Schreiber et al. 2021).

Previous studies reported that oleuropein could reduce the production of IL-6 and increase the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines in colitis and colorectal cancer models (Giner et al. 2016; Larussa et al. 2017; Deiana et al. 2018). An investigation explored the effect of administration of germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) on inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α. The findings showed that IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly reduced in the GBF-treated group compared with baseline (Faghfoori et al. 2011). Cladosiphon fucoidan, a dietary substance, also might help treat colitis. An investigation revealed that DAI, MPO, and IL-6 were significantly decreased following administration of Cladosiphon fucoidan in DDS-induced mice models (Matsumoto et al. 2004). A study on DDS-induced colitis mice models suggested that Lizhong Decoction (LZD) could be used to treat UC. After treatment, colonic inflammation was remarkably alleviated via inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators, including IL-1, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, nitric oxide (NO) and suppressing the activity of MPO and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Fascinatingly, the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly decreased following LZD treatment. Furthermore, LZD significantly reduced the mRNA level of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and NF-κB and increased the expression of claudin-1, zonula occluden-1, and occludin to reduce gut inflammation and improve the intestinal barrier (Shen et al. 2020). It has been reported that other compounds, such as tilapia head glycolipids (TH-GLs) and Jiangxiangru (JXR), had beneficial effects on reducing gut IL-6-mediated inflammation (Gu et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2021).

# Colitis-associated cancer

One of the reasons that researchers have increasingly considered IBD is to provide the appropriate conditions for CRC and the development of this malignancy in humans. A study on mice models of colitis revealed that administration of Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) could pointedly improve colitis severity which was proved by histological damage, colon length, and the disease activity index (DAI) scores. Moreover, treatment by Y-27632 significantly reduced CD68 and pro-inflammatory mediators.
