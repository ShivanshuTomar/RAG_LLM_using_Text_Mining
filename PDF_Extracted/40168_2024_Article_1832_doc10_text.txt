# Significant Roles of Gut Bacteria and Viruses in IBD

There has been a notable lack of information regarding the involvement of viruses. The limitations in studying the gut virome within the context of specific diseases can be attributed to two primary technical challenges. First, detection methods for viral communities have often been restricted to either VLP or bulk metagenomics, lacking comprehensive cross-validation. Second, despite the construction of several large viral genome reference databases, there remains a substantial reservoir of unexplored viral sequences within the human gut [16, 26]. This reliance on reference databases for gut virome analysis significantly restricts the scope of viral investigations.

In this study, we sought to overcome these challenges by employing both VLP and bulk metagenomics sequencing methods in a cohort of individuals to conduct an extensive investigation into the “whole gut virome” associated with IBD. Notably, these two sequencing approaches demonstrated distinctions in their capacity to capture viruses. In alignment with prior assumptions [19, 30], VLP sequencing exhibited a preference for capturing free viral particles, particularly those from the Microviridae family, whereas bulk sequencing was more adept at reconstructing viral sequences that had partly integrated into bacterial hosts.

Furthermore, we constructed a reference gut viral catalog that represented more than 10,000 nonredundant vOTUs based on our high-depth sequenced samples. The majority (61.2%) of vOTUs in this study were not present in existing gut virus catalogs (i.e., the Gut Virome Database (GVD) [30], Gut Phage Database (GPD) [39], or Metagenomic Gut Virus (MGV) [40]) (Supplementary Fig. 13), and almost all vOTUs had no homology with the viruses in the NCBI RefSeq database. These findings suggest that our catalog substantially supplements the deficiencies of previous viral references, allowing for a more comprehensive examination of the IBD gut virome. Overall, our results underscore the significance of utilizing complementary sequencing techniques and viral reference databases to fully explore the diversity of viruses within the human gut. This study presents a paradigm for future virome-wide studies of other relevant disorders.

# Characteristics of the IBD Gut Virome and Viral Signatures

The results from both the VLP and bulk datasets consistently indicated an increase in eukaryotic virome richness and evenness in IBD patients compared to healthy controls. In particular, two eukaryotic viral families, Retroviridae and Genomoviridae, were found to be enriched in IBD patients. Although the overgrowth of the Retroviridae family in the gut has been implicated in several diseases including CD [26, 41], its specific influence on IBD remains unclear. Our analysis showed that VLP data supported the enrichment of Anelloviridae in IBD patients, whereas bulk data yielded the opposite result. Considering that at the vOTU level, the majority of Anelloviridae vOTUs in both VLP and bulk samples were enriched in patients, we believe that the enrichment of Anelloviridae in patients appears to be more credible.

The enrichment of Anelloviridae was also previously observed in a study of onset CD [22], possibly related to long-term immune therapy [42, 43]. Notably, another study focusing on the gut mucosa virome found significantly greater levels of eukaryotic Hepadnaviridae transcripts in patients with UC than in both healthy controls and CD patients [20]. However, this phenomenon was not observed in our datasets.

In terms of the prokaryotic virome, the alpha diversity results for the VLP and bulk datasets revealed diametrically opposite findings. In the bulk dataset, we observed a significant decrease in prokaryotic virome diversity in IBD patients compared with the controls, and it exhibited a significant positive correlation with bacteriome diversity. Previous studies have extensively reported a substantial decrease in bacterial diversity in IBD patients [44–46]. These findings demonstrated a strong dependency of the bacterial community on the prokaryotic viral community in the bulk dataset. In contrast, the VLP dataset showed a significant increase in prokaryotic virome diversity in the IBD group, which was entirely unrelated to the bacteriome.

Combining these findings with previous research suggesting that VLPs may preferentially capture free-floating viruses outside host cells, while bulk analysis captures a greater proportion of intracellular viral communities. These observations suggest a more frequent occurrence of prokaryotic cell lysis within the gut of IBD patients.

At the family level, we found that Siphoviridae and Myoviridae were significantly enriched in IBD patients, while crAss-like and Quimbyviridae were decreased. Siphoviridae and Myoviridae constitute the major viral communities in the human gut [1]; most members of these two families are temperate viruses, but their functions in the IBD virome remain unknown. Additionally, both Siphoviridae and Myoviridae belong to the order Caudovirales, and their enrichment was consistent with previous studies of the IBD virome [5, 47]. At the vOTU level, we also identified numerous IBD-enriched Siphoviridae and Myoviridae vOTUs. These vOTUs contained a large proportion of phages infecting bacteria such as Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterococcus_B, Streptococcus, and Veillonella. Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterococcus spp. are typical opportunistic pathogens capable of inducing inflammation and triggering various diseases [48–50], and their pathogenicity in IBD has been recently reported [51, 52].
