# Concluding remarks

Based on the existing findings and reviewed studies, chronic inflammation underlies IBD, and the IL-6/IL-6R axis can be considered a therapeutic target as an important part of developing this chronic inflammation. On the other hand, this chronic inflammation can increase the development of CAC. A wide range of inhibitors with relatively promising outcomes, including natural compounds, anti-IL-6/IL-6R mAbs, as well as small molecules, have been used to inhibit the IL-6/IL-6R axis in IBD and CAC. However, considering the multiple roles of IL-6 in enhancing the integrity of the epithelial barrier and intestinal homeostasis and inhibiting the infection caused by various microorganisms in the intestinal mucosa, the question arises about whether inhibiting the IL-6/IL-6R axis is always in favor of treatment? The involvement of a wide range of inflammatory mediators in developing chronic inflammation complicates treatment, and monotherapy may not be as successful in the clinic.

For this reason, more studies in this field are needed to discover novel and optimized therapeutic methods such as modulation of the gut microbiome composition using probiotics or natural compounds with minimal side effects to preserve the physiological functions of IL-6. Several of these compounds and their action against intestinal inflammation and microbiome alteration have been introduced in this study. It is possible that these compounds could be used as a therapeutic combination with other IL-6/IL-6R axis inhibitors to benefit from their synergistic effects. Because according to studies, the effect of microbiome-altering compounds
