butyriciproducens, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. However, although three control-enriched vOTUs, v0c24 v0d26, and v1d95, were crucial to the prediction accuracy of most classification models, their taxonomic annotation and host preference remain completely unknown. On the other hand, the ten IBD-enriched vOTUs were found to frequently infect opportunistic pathogens, including Citrobacter farmeri, Escherichia coli, and Escherichia fergusonii (Fig. 4d).

We also performed cross-dataset prediction based on these 33 IBD-associated vOTUs (Supplementary Fig. 9). The cross-dataset RF models achieved an average AUC of 0.758 (ranging from 0.496 to 0.922). Considering the variation in sample sizes across datasets, we performed a leave-one-dataset-out (LODO) analysis, where each dataset was treated as a test dataset in turn. The LODO AUCs ranged from 0.599 to 0.919, with an average AUC of 0.799 (Supplementary Fig. 9). Collectively, these results demonstrate the robustness of the IBD-associated viral signatures identified in this study across diverse datasets, highlighting their potential as reliable targets for future microbiota intervention studies in IBD patients.

# Colonization of IBD‑associated viruses regulates experimental colitis in mice

Although IBD-associated gut viral signatures have been identified, experimental evidence regarding the influence of these viruses on IBD is limited. To address this, we conducted fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) from either IBD patients or healthy subjects into broad spectrum antibiotic-treated mice to generate human microbiota-associated (HMA) mice, followed by high-dose FVT from patients and controls into these HMA mice and the administration of 2% DSS in their drinking water to induce experimental colitis (Fig. 5a). The donors for these experiments, including eight IBD patients (three CD patients and five UC patients) and seven healthy individuals, were randomly selected from our original cohort, and their fresh feces and fecal virus-like particles were pooled for the FMT and FVT procedures, respectively (see “Methods” for details).

We then assessed the viral and bacterial composition of mouse feces before and after the FVT procedures using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Low levels of viruses were detectable in the HMA mice before FVT, possibly reflecting the baseline proportion of viruses in their feces (Fig. 5b). Following FVT and DSS-induced colitis, we observed that the mice receiving the fecal virome from healthy donors (referred to as “HC-FVT mice”) showed a significant expansion of control-enriched vOTUs compared to their pre-FVT state, with average relative abundances increasing from 2.0% to 52.4% (Student’s t-test p = 2.5 × 10 –8). Similarly, the mice that received the virome from IBD patients (referred to as “IBD-FVT mice”) exhibited a substantial expansion of IBD-enriched vOTUs, with average relative abundances increasing from 2.3% to 44.9% (p = 9.1 × 10 –8). We also estimated the virus-to-bacterium ratio of mouse feces and found that this ratio reached 51–1087 (average 366 in HC-FVT mice and 272 in IBD-FVT mice) in post-FVT samples (Supplementary Fig. 10), suggesting that the overgrowth of these viruses may have overwhelmed the existing bacterial content in the mouse gut microbiota. These findings demonstrate that the recipient mice efficiently recapitulated the viral features of the patient or control donors virome.

Next, we compared colitis-related symptoms in mice from the HC-FVT, IBD-FVT, and sham FVT groups. After DSS induction, the mice exhibited a colitis phenotype characterized by body weight loss, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, colon shortening, pathological changes, increased levels of inflammatory factors, and decreased expression of tight junction proteins, indicating that DSS induced colonic inflammation and impaired gut barrier function. Regardless of whether the initial FMT was from IBD patients or healthy donors, we found that compared with the sham group, the HC-FVT group exhibited reduced colitis-related symptoms, including a significant reduction in the disease activity index (DAI), an elongated colon length, and less severe pathological colon injury (Fig. 5c-e). In contrast, the IBD-FVT group displayed exacerbated colitis, with greater DAI scores, more severe pathological injuries, and shorter colons than both the HC-FVT and sham groups (Fig. 5c-e and Supplementary Fig. 11). Moreover, the expression levels of adhesion and tight junction-related proteins, such as E-cadherin, β-catenin, and occludin, were upregulated in the HF-FVT group and downregulated in the IBD-FVT group (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 12), indicating improved gut permeability in the HF-FVT group and worsened gut permeability in the IBD-FVT group. Additionally, the IBD-FVT group, irrespective of whether the HMA mice received microbiota from IBD patients or healthy donors, exhibited significantly greater levels of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ, and IL-1β, than the HC-FVT or sham groups (Fig. 5g). In contrast, the HC-FVT group exhibited reduced levels of certain cytokines such as IL-6, IFN-γ, and IL-1β in IBD HMA mice compared with those in the sham group (Fig. 5g). Taken together, these findings indicate that the colonization of viruses from healthy donors (HC-FVT) has a mitigating effect on colitis in a mouse model, whereas that of viruses from IBD patients (IBD-FVT) exacerbates colitis with a substantial expansion of IBD-enriched vOTUs in the mouse gut microbiota.
