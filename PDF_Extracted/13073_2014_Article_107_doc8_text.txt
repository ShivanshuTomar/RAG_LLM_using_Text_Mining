causality, our analyses demonstrate complex host genetic associations with taxonomic and metabolic dysbiosis in humans. These include implications of microbiome-wide associations with TNFSF15, IL12B, and with innate immune response, inflammatory response, and the JAK-STAT pathway, as well as NOD2-related increases in Enterobacteriaceae relative abundance. Future studies may be warranted to account for the effects of copy number variation, pleiotropic genes and epigenetic modifications. It is also possible that certain genotype-microbiome associations observed in IBD patients may be disease-independent and may be relevant to healthy individuals and individuals with other diseases. The methods we employed were validated on independent cohorts and make possible well-powered false-positive-controlled testing of microbiome-wide host genetic associations.
