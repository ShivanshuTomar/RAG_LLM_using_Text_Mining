# Mesenchymal stem cell–gut microbiota interaction in the repair of inflammatory bowel disease: an enhanced therapeutic effect

# Ocansey et al. Clin Trans Med (2019) 8:31

# Abstract

Background: Several investigations affirm that, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit dysbiosis characterized by restricted biodiversity and imbalanced bacterial composition intertwined with immune dysregulation. The interaction between stem cells and gut microbiota is a novel and highly promising field that could add up to a better understanding of the gut physiology, as well as therapeutic improvement towards diseases like IBD. Through direct contact or release of products and/or metabolites, gut bacteria regulate gut homeostasis, damage repair, regeneration and differentiation of stem cells. In the same way, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) produce similar effects including restoration of gut–microbiome composition.

Body: We reviewed the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, pathogenic bacterial clearance, proliferation and tissue remodeling effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as separate transplants in IBD, and the outcome of the interaction between MSCs and gut microbiota.

Conclusion: The two therapies share several points of connection in therapeutics with enhanced functionalities in their interaction with each other. Focused investigations of MSC–gut bacteria interactions could lead to a novel discovery in therapeutics. We also anticipate an improved clinical remission rate in a combined FMT–MSC transplantation approach in IBD than the current single FMT or MSC approach.

# Background

Microbiome is known to partake in a wide range of important roles such as hematopoiesis [1], immune system modulation and development [2], neurologic signaling [3], host metabolism [4], and remodeling of bone mass [5] in the mammalian tissue. Characterized by chronic and relapsing intestinal mucosa inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is generally defined as either Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) with related causes being genetic, gut (microbial and immune changes), environmental and lifestyle factors. The participation of gut–microbiota in the pathophysiology of IBD has lately been highlighted with the outcome suggesting a crucial function of the gut–microbiota in the intestinal inflammation and even in colorectal cancer [6]. Even though it has not clearly been determined how the dysbiosis observed participates in intestinal inflammation, it is however recognized that several of the documented IBD susceptibility genes are linked with recognizing and
