and 7828 (29.13%) were statistically significantly different contributed more to potentially harmful metabolites, such as lactate, hydrogen sulfide, and TMAO.

between healthy and IBD (Supplementary Table 4a), and dysbiotic and non-dysbiotic IBD (Supplementary Table 4b), microbiomes, respectively. Hence, a wide variety of metabolic fluxes was distinct in dysbiotic microbiomes. A principal coordinates analysis of all 26,873 strain-to-metabolite demonstrated that the dysbiotic IBD microbiomes clustered separately from both the healthy and the non-dysbiotic IBD microbiomes (Fig. 3c). Again, this separation was expected as the models directly reflected the distinct microbiome compositions of the dysbiotic IBD patients.

Next, we investigated the contributions that were distinct in dysbiotic microbiomes by taxon. The contributions were summarised by phylum and by metabolite subsystem for the three clusters (Fig. 5a). The contribution flux profiles in the dysbiotic cluster clearly differed from both the healthy and non-dysbiotic IBD cluster, showing a drastic reduction in Bacteroidetes contributions accompanied by an increase in Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria contributions (Fig. 5a). This result is in line with observations that the dysbiotic cluster was characterised by an increase in gammaproteobacterial genera, and a corresponding decrease in Bacteroidetes and Clostridia. While the non-dysbiotic cluster’s phylum to subsystem contributions resembled overall the profile of the healthy cluster, there was a slight increase in Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria contributions compared with the latter (Fig. 5a). This change may indicate that the individuals in the non-dysbiotic IBD cluster represent an early state in the development towards pronounced dysbiosis as observed in the dysbiotic cluster. The altered contribution profiles in the dysbiotic cluster were observed across all metabolic subsystems (Fig. 4a) demonstrating a broad effect of microbial composition changes on metabolite fluxes.

To gain more insight into metabolites of interest that were enriched or depleted in the dysbiotic cluster, we extracted the strain contributions (Supplementary Table 6) by metabolite. For instance, not only the total butyrate production flux was reduced in dysbiotic IBD microbiomes (Fig. 2a), but the contributing strains also differed between dysbiotic and non-dysbiotic microbiomes (Supplementary Fig. 3). As expected, known butyrate producers, e.g., Roseburia spp., Faecalibacterium praunitzii, and Eubacterium rectale, contributed the majority of butyrate in healthy and non-dysbiotic IBD microbiomes, while in dysbiotic microbiomes, butyrate secretion by these species was reduced (Supplementary Fig. 3). Reduced butyrate levels in IBD patients with dysbiosis have previously been attributed to reduced abundance of Roseburia and Faecalibacterium spp. For L-lactate, hydrogen sulfide, and TMAO, the total production potential was increased in dysbiotic microbiomes (Fig. 2c), and production of these compounds could mainly be attributed to Gammaproteobacteria genera, e.g., Escherichia spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., and Sutterella spp. (Supplementary Fig. 4–6). On the other hand, nicotinamide, which was clearly reduced in the dysbiotic cluster (Fig. 2d), was synthesised by representatives of the Bacteroidia class. Thus, through metabolic modelling, we could retrieve a strain and individual-resolved, detailed snapshot of each metabolite of interest. Butyrate, L-lactate, TMAO, and hydrogen sulfide were produced by a combination of multiple species, explaining why no strong correlations with any individual species were observed for these metabolites. This result highlights that species-metabolite links may be missed in correlation-based approaches and demonstrates the added value of strain-and molecule-resolved simulations.

To summarise, we systematically interrogated the gut microbe-metabolite axis through constraint-based modelling. For each metabolite, the exact contributing strains were identified (Supplementary Figs. 3–7 and Supplementary Table 6). Overall, commensal and beneficial taxa contributed more to metabolites that are thought to be relevant for health (e.g., butyrate, B-vitamins), and taxa associated with dysbiosis (i.e., Proteobacteria, Bacilli) greatly varied across individual microbiomes reflecting the variation in.

# DISCUSSION

We have systematically profiled the metabolic potential of 108 individual microbiomes in silico. The metabolic profiles varied greatly across individual microbiomes reflecting the variation in.
