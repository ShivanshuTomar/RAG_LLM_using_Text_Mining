differentially abundant proteins (C-reactive protein, dual oxidase 2 and complement component 4 binding protein alpha chain) that were common for all regions (Supplementary Fig. 7). Among the 59 IBD-related differentially abundant human proteins, 58 were increased in IBD, with only the chloride anion exchanger (S26A3) decreased. Protein interaction networks of these 59 proteins yielded significant protein interactions (PPI enrichment p < 0.0001 as assessed using STRING 32) (Fig. 6b). In the protein network, integrin alpha M (ITGAM; also known as CD11b), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and integrin beta-2 (ITGB2; also known as CD18) displayed the highest degree of interaction, connecting with 17, 17, and 15 proteins in the network, respectively (Fig. 6b), suggesting a “hub” role for these proteins.

Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the 59 differentially abundant human proteins demonstrated that the mostly enriched biological functions include immune and defense responses against bacterium or fungi (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Data 8).

In addition, the majority of proteins were related to extracellular region (51/59) and/or extracellular exosome (50/59) (Fig. 6d). Interestingly, among the 3493 human proteins quantified in this study, 2340 proteins matched to the EVpedia database of EVs and 88 matched the top 100 EV proteins (defined by the frequency of identification in previous EV datasets) 33,34. The relative abundance of EV proteins that correspond to the top 100 list demonstrated a significant increase in both CD and UC as compared to control, in particular in the TI of CD patients and the DeC of UC patients (p < 0.001; Fig. 6e), regions of the intestine which are most often inflamed for their respective subtypes. In addition, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination of the pellet fraction of aspirate samples, which confirmed the presence of vesicles consistent in size with that of shed intestinal microvesicles or exosomes (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b).

To gain insights on the host-microbiome interaction, we performed co-occurrence analysis with all identified differentially abundant human proteins and microbial functions, and found that both human proteins and microbial functions showed substantial associations with each other (Supplementary Fig. 9). Microbial uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG, COG1573) displayed the highest connections (n = 48) to human proteins acting as important microbial hub in connecting the host and microbiome nodes. UDG is an enzyme which participates in mutagenesis prevention, as part of the base-excision repair pathway and cleaves uracil, as well as oxidized cytosine derivatives generated under conditions with high oxidative stress35. As mentioned above, 13 out of the 54 significantly increased microbial COGs belonged to category L and V that were related to DNA damage/mismatch responses, indicating that in IBD, microbes are deploying a considerable number of defensive mechanisms against stressors derived from the host.

# Pediatric IBD MLI extracellular vesicle proteome changes.

To further expand the EV protein findings, we isolated free EVs that were present in MLI supernatants from a cohort of 11 new-onset IBD participants and 7 controls (Supplementary Data 9) and performed the first proteomic characterization of intestinal EVs from pediatric IBD patients. Electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) analysis showed that the isolated vesicles were membrane-enclosed and consistent in size with that of exosomes, shed microvesicles and bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMV, Fig. 6f, g). No significant difference was observed between the mean sizes of EVs isolated from children with IBD and controls (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Proteomic analysis identified a total of 2744 proteins (1519 human proteins; 1225 microbial proteins). The intensity-based microbial abundance across all samples was 12.6% and was lower in the EVs isolated from IBD than those isolated from controls (Fig. 6h). Of those microbial peptide sequences which were taxonomically assigned at the phylum level, the majority were derived from Bacteroidetes (70.7%; genus Bacteroides and Prevotella) followed by Firmicutes (25.6%; Faecalibacterium) (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Phylum level comparative analyses indicated that Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were significantly increased in IBD EVs, coinciding with the abovementioned metaproteomic findings (Supplementary Fig. 10b–d). Of the top 100 proteins in ExoCarta, 81 were identified in this dataset and yielded a mean exosomal protein abundance of 12% across all samples with a significant increase observed in IBD (Fig. 6i). This observation may partly be due to the elevated MLI human proteins in IBD (Fig. 1c). We also identified exosomal markers implicated in exosome biogenesis including CD9, CD63, TSG101, ALIX/PDCD6IP, FLOT1, FLOT2, Rab27A and the bacterial OMV marker OmpA (Supplementary Table 1)36. Moreover, proteins previously deemed as under-represented in EVs36 were either not identified or present at low abundances (Supplementary Table 1).

The PCA analysis of the free EV human proteins displays an obvious segregation between IBD and control subjects (Fig. 6j). A total of 64 proteins were identified as discriminant features that were either identified with PLS-DA (Q2 = 0.81; 37 proteins) or overrepresented in IBD or control (identified in >70% of IBD and <30% control or vice versa; 18 proteins). Comparing the 64 free EV differentially expressed human proteins with the aforementioned 59 differentially abundant MLI microbiome-associated human proteins yielded considerable overlap with 20 proteins identified in both datasets, such as MPO and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) (Supplementary Fig. 8d, e). Interestingly, these 64 EV proteins yielded significant enrichment of biological processes relating to innate immunity and host defense, including phagocytosis, immune response, defense response to fungus, and defense response to bacterium (Supplementary Data 10).

# Discussion

We, and others, have shown that aberrant microbiota–host crosstalk plays a central role in the pathogenesis of pediatric CD9,37, however, the mechanisms underlying this complex interplay in disease remains unclear. Through a metaproteomic approach, the current study identified both functional alterations of microbiome and the associated human protein signatures at the intestinal MLI in new-onset pediatric IBD patients, including those that have not been readily reported with metagenomics or metatranscriptomics6,26,38. Moreover, we demonstrated that the host defense proteins present in the intestinal EVs, including oxidative antimicrobial substrates, which would contribute to the excessive oxidative stress in the gut and thus abnormal host-microbiota interactions. A graphic summary of the study design and main findings is shown in Fig. 7. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of host–microbiome interaction and its role in the pathogenesis of IBD.

In evaluating the metaproteome of the intestinal MLI aspirate samples, we identified a substantial amount of human proteins. Interestingly a large proportion (67%) of these identified human proteins corresponded to proteins found in the EV protein databases33. EVs are membrane-bounded, protecting their cargo from proteases and nucleases which enables the delivery of bioactive molecules to neighboring cells, and thus EVs act as important mediators of long distance cell–cell communication and interaction39. In the intestinal lumen, EVs can be derived from multiple sources including intestinal epithelial/immune cells and microbial cells. Timár et al. demonstrated that EVs derived
