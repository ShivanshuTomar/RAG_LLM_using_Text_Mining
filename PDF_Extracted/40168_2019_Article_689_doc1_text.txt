# Introduction

The human gut microbiome performs essential functions for human health and is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of complex diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and type II diabetes [1]. Since the etiology of these diseases is multifactorial, they can be seen as having a malfunctioning network rather than a single cause [1]. To understand the interplay between the factors underlying the disease network, such as genome, microbiome, and diet, computational systems biology approaches are necessary to integrate the different -omes, such as metagenome and metabolome, and to identify key interactions in an unbiased manner [1]. Such data-driven systems biology approaches could also identify drug-network interactions [1] and predict individual treatment responses in patients [1, 2].

One important function carried out by the human gut microbiome is the deconjugation of human primary bile acids and their subsequent biotransformation to secondary bile acids with implications for human health [3]. Briefly, the human liver synthesizes the primary bile acids cholate (CA) and chenodeoxycholate (CDCA), which are each conjugated with either taurine or glycine [4]. Conjugated bile acids are stored in the gall bladder and released into the small intestine after a meal [4]. In the intestine, they are subject to extensive metabolism by gut microbes, namely deconjugation of glycine or taurine, and biotransformation of the unconjugated primary bile acids to secondary bile acids [4]. Primary and secondary bile acids have endocrine functions and modulate host metabolism [3]; thus, their composition has important implications for human health. A link between microbial bile acid metabolism and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), i.e., ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s Disease, has been repeatedly demonstrated [5]. In IBD patients, fecal conjugated bile acid levels are higher while secondary bile acid levels are lower and the deconjugation and transformation abilities of IBD-associated microbiomes are impaired [5]. Other diseases that have been associated with alterations of the intestinal bile acids pool include liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, short bowel syndrome, and obesity [3, 6]; however, a mechanistic understanding of these bile acid-microbiome-disease associations is lacking. Thus, the role of bile acid composition and its relationship with the gut microbiome in these diseases needs to be elucidated and to be considered for therapeutic options [6].

A well-established computational approach for modeling human and microbial metabolism is Constraint-based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) [7]. The COBRA approach relies on having genome-scale reconstruction of a target organism, which assembled based on the organism’s genome sequence and manually curated against the available genomic data and literature following established protocols [8]. A genome-scale reconstruction can readily be converted into a mathematical model, in which reactions and metabolites are represented as a stochiometric matrix, and interrogated using established methods such as flux balance analysis (FBA) [9]. Briefly, FBA relies on physicochemical (e.g., mass-charge balance) and environmental (e.g., nutrient uptake) constraints that limit the flow of metabolites through the network resulting in a solution space of feasible flux distributions [9]. Generally, FBA relies on the definition of an objective function, such as the biomass reaction, which sums all known precursors required to form a new cell. The objective function is then minimized or maximized, and the optimal solution, aka flux distribution, under the given condition-specific constraints is computed [9]. FBA operates under the steady-state assumption and as such does not require kinetic parameters to compute an optimal solution [9]. Through implementation of condition-specific constraints, e.g., a certain dietary regime, COBRA simulations have provided further insight into the metabolic capabilities of, e.g., human intestinal microbes [10–14], for which a comprehensive collection of reconstructions (AGORA) has been published [15, 16]. An advantage of the COBRA approach for microbial community modeling is that the underlying genome-scale metabolic networks enable mechanistic predictions of metabolic fluxes in each individual species while taking into account biological features, such as substrate availability or species-species boundaries [17, 18]. Previous studies have already demonstrated the use of constraint-based multi-species models for the prediction of host-microbe interactions [12, 19] and gut microbial community interactions [13, 20]. COBRA models can also be contextualized through omics data, e.g., metagenomic data [2, 14]. More importantly, by mapping metagenomic data of an individual, the metabolic microbial community model is personalized to this individual enabling the prediction of personalized metabolic profiles, which can be used to ultimately stratify disease and control groups [2, 14].

# Results

To investigate the microbiome-level bile-acid production potential of healthy individuals and IBD patients, we derived a systematic, reproducible workflow (Fig. 1). First, we expanded bile acid metabolism pathways captured in 232 gut microbial reconstructions using state-of-the-art comparative genomics methods. We then joined these reconstructions into pairwise microbial models and predicted their potential to cooperatively produce secondary bile acids. While each microbe could only produce up to six of the 13 secondary bile acids in silico, microbial
