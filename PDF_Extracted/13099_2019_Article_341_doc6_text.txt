sample ranged from 6936 to 100,972, with an average of 38,931 reads per sample.

# Bioinformatic analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing data

16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing data was analysed by following the workflow from Callahan et al. [33]. Quality checking, filtering and trimming of fastq files were performed by functions from the dada2 package in R [34]. After filtering the reads, high-resolution Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were inferred using dada function [34]. ASVs are a higher-resolution analogue of the traditional OTUs. Chimeric sequences were removed and taxonomy assigned to ASVs based on the naive Bayesian classifier method with silva_nr_v132_train_set.fa as the training set [34]. Species-richness and alpha diversity (Shannon) were analysed by plot_richness function from the phyloseq package in R [35]. To make the rarefaction species richness curve, ‘rarecurve’ function from the vegan package [36] in R was used.

# Statistical analysis: bacterial family co-abundance network based on microbiome data

Taxonomic assignments, containing a detailed taxonomy and abundance data of OTUs or ASVs in samples, of 113 gut microbiome studies, covering more than 22,000 samples, were downloaded from the EBI metagenomics database [1]. The data were then parsed and tables containing bacterial abundance from different phyla, classes and families were generated. Abundance at the level of phylum was then used for the global gut microbial abundance. The family-level bacterial abundance was used to construct the bacterial family–family coexistence network. For each pair of bacterial families, Pearson’s correlation test was performed. Family nodes were connected when P-value < 1e−10 and Pearson’s correlation coefficient > 0.3.
