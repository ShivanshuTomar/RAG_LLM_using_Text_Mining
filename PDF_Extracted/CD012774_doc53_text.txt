cation was masked to the patient, health care workers caring for the patient, and investigators. The technician administering FMT or placebo was aware of the treatment being administered, as the nature of the intervention meant that it was not possible to make it identical to the placebo." (page 103)

Comment: most likely done.

# Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)

Low risk

Quote: "The randomization was held centrally at the McMaster Gastroenterology Clinical Trials Unit to ensure concealment of allocation. The treatment location was masked to the patient, health care workers caring for the patient, and investigators. The technician administering FMT or placebo was aware of the treatment being administered, as the nature of the intervention meant that it was not possible to make it identical to the placebo." (page 103)

Comment: most likely done.

# Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)

Low risk

Quote: "The randomization was held centrally at the McMaster Gastroenterology Clinical Trials Unit to ensure concealment of allocation. The treatment location was masked to the patient, health care workers caring for the patient, and investigators. The technician administering FMT or placebo was aware of the treatment being administered, as the nature of the intervention meant that it was not possible to make it identical to the placebo." (page 103)

Comment: most likely done.

# Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)

Low risk

Comment: 1/38 (2.6%) participants withdrew from the experimental group and 3/37 (8.1%) withdrew from the control group.

All outcomes

# Selective reporting (reporting bias)

Low risk

Comment: all intended outcomes were reported in the paper. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01545908).

# Other bias

Low risk

Comment: trial was stopped early due to futility; however, data were completely described for included participants.
