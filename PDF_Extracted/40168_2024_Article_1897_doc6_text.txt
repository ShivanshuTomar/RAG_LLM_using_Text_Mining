We next asked whether the assignment of succinotypes to individuals remained stable over time using two of the cohorts. The Broad Institute-OpenBiome Microbiome Library (BIO-ML) and the Health Practitioners Follow-up Study (HPFS) comprise individuals that were sampled more than once. From these data, we computed the transition probabilities between succinotypes, that is, the fraction of times an individual changed its succinotypes from D to P or vice versa. In BIO-ML, individuals retained the same succinotype in the subsequent fecal sample 88.9% and 94.4% of the time for D and P, respectively (Fig. 4b), and the same was confirmed in the HPFS study (92% and 94%, Supplementary Figure S6). This demonstrates that individuals can be robustly classified into either a “D” or “P” succinotype based on their cross-sectional microbiome composition.

The relative abundance of the succinate utilizers did not differ between healthy individuals with different succinotypes. For each healthy subject, we computed the total relative abundance of succinate utilizers as the sum of relative abundances of D and P. The succinate utilizers had a mean relative abundance of 1.14%, with a 95% of the samples between 0.11 and 12.0% (Fig. 4c). We tested for a difference in relative abundance of the succinate utilizers between individuals that were assigned to either succinotype. To account for potential variability between datasets, we used a mixed-effects model with random slopes and intercepts for the succinotype across cohorts. There was no consistent significant effect of succinotype on the log relative abundance (p = 0.503). This implies that the size of the “succinate utilization niche” is conserved and hence does not depend on the identity of the taxon that occupies the niche.

We hypothesized that the lower rate of succinate consumption by Dialister as compared to Phascolarctobacterium would imply that the net concentration of succinate is higher in D-type as compared to P-type individuals. To test this, we used the metabolomic data from the BIO-ML cohort. Fecal succinate concentrations were significantly higher in D-types compared to P-types (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.001619; Fig. 4d), and there was no significant effect of the relative abundance of succinate utilizers in a linear model including both succinotype and relative abundance (p = 0.559, Supplementary Figure S7). These results support the notion that the niche size of succinate consumption does not differ between succinotypes, but that the slower removal of succinate by Dialister manifests as a higher net succinate concentration.

Given these increased levels of intestinal succinate and the reported role of succinate in inflammation [3], we hypothesized that a Dialister succinotype would be more prone to intestinal inflammation—and possibly at higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We tested for an effect of succinotype on IBD status using all cohorts in a logistic regression on succinotype with cohort as a random effect.

IBD patients were consistently more likely to be D-types than P-types (Fig. 4e). The odds ratio of IBD versus healthy was 2.2 times lower for P-types compared to D-types (logit regression, β = −0.805, CI = [−1.16, −0.449], p = 9.27 · 10−6). We thus asked whether succinate concentrations are disproportionately higher in D-type IBD patients than P-types using the metabolomic data from the PRISM cohort [30], for which taxonomic composition based on shotgun metagenomic data paired with metabolomic data were available [31]. Consistent with the data from BIO-ML, fecal succinate concentrations were higher in D-types than in P-types, but the difference was not significantly different from that in healthy individuals (Fig. 4f; two-way ANOVA, FIBD(1, 217) = 2.32, pIBD = 0.12, FStype(1, 217) = 6.29, pStype = 0.013). Overall, this suggests that the Dialister succinotype contributes in some manner to IBD pathogenesis, likely as the result of its slower consumption of succinate.

Finally, to check to which extent the association of succinotypes with disease was specific to IBD, we looked at the succinotype distributions in a set of other diseases that were part of the curatedMetagenomicDatasets package. Two diseases, colorectal cancer (CRC) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD), were associated with the P succinotype (Supplementary Figure S8). However, none of the other tested diseases were significantly associated with the D succinotype, indeed suggesting a specific role of high Dialister or low Phascolarctobacterium in IBD.

# Discussion

The goal of this study was to map out which human intestinal bacteria are the main consumers of succinate—a metabolite that is at a key crossroad of human and microbiome metabolism. Our multi-faceted analysis of fecal microbiota and bacterial isolates identified two bacterial taxonomic groups as key succinate consumers in human intestinal microbiomes, Phascolarctobacterium and Dialister. These two taxa are highly mutually exclusive in fecal microbiomes of western populations, allowing for the clear classification of individuals into P and D “succinotypes.” These succinotypes differ with respect to their succinate consumption rate, with the D types consuming succinate more slowly than the P-succinotypes, and this translates to higher fecal concentrations of succinate. Finally, while the prevalence of succinotypes in healthy populations is rather balanced, IBD patients are significantly more likely to have a D-succinotype than a P-succinotype. This provides evidence for an imbalance.
