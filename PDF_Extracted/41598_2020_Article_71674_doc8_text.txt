Escherichia coli O157:H7 (239–245), Klebsiella oxytoca (197–253), Salmonella typhimurium (239–245), Shigella dysenteriae (239–245) and Yersinia enterocolitica (230–284).

Experimental evidences to identify the signature molecules in patients. The in-silico analysis followed for the molecular signature identification till far through gene expression datasets and curated metabolic reconstructs strongly indicate the host protein, KYNU being the singular common predictive markers for all pathogenic microbes. KYNU has also been indicated in the expression data of inflammatory linked disorder.
