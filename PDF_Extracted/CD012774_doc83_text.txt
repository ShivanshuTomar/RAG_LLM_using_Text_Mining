- Treatment for malignancy within past 5 years
- Concurrent Clostridioides difficile or other infections
- Active or latent tuberculosis
- Clinically meaningful laboratory abnormalities, such as hemoglobin < 8 and alanine aminotransferase > 3 × upper limit of normal
- History of anaphylactic reactions to food allergens or allergy to psyllium husk
- Any other condition that, as deemed by study investigator, would jeopardize the safety or rights of study participant, influence completion of study, or confound the study

# Interventions

# Experimental arm

- Investigational FMT once at day 0 via colonoscopy + placebo FMP250 at week 8 via flexible sigmoidoscopy
- Investigational FMT once at day 0 via colonoscopy + placebo FMP250 at week 8 via flexible sigmoidoscopy + psyllium (twice daily for 8 weeks)

# Control arm

- Placebo FMT once at day 0 via colonoscopy + investigational FMP250 at week 8 via flexible sigmoidoscopy ± psyllium (twice daily for 8 weeks)

# Outcomes

# Primary outcomes

- Clinical response at week 8 (post-FMT reduction of Mayo score by > 3 (+30% reduction) with accompanying decrease in Rectal Bleeding subscore ≥ 1)

# Secondary outcomes

- Clinical remission at week 8 (post-FMT Mayo score ≤ 2 without any subscore > 1)
- Endoscopic response or remission at week 8 (post-FMT Mayo Endoscopic subscore 0–1 with ≥ 1 reduction from baseline or Mayo Endoscopic subscore 0)
- Number and type of treatment-related adverse events between week 0 colonoscopy and week 12 post-FMT
- Change in number of disease-related complications such as hospitalizations, surgeries; and endoscopies; medical complications; and mortality between week 0 colonoscopy and week 12 post-FMT
