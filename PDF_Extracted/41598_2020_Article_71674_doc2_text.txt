approach has advantages over the traditional approach for network analysis that can help to simultaneously characterize several protein interaction modules and has the potential to study complex diseases. The vital information obtained in our study from in-silico analysis is cross-validated through targeted gene expression experimental analysis on patient cohorts. This study will help us to obtain clinico-molecular informatics-based outcomes and expand our knowledge regarding the understanding of biological functions for IBD co-existent ReA.

# Materials and methods

# Text mining: data screening and selection.

Systematic data search and organization was carried out incorporating data identification, data screening and data selection to find target microorganisms involved in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Reactive Arthritis (ReA). Data identification was carried out to obtain records through data sources utilising keywords (e.g. “Microorganism AND Inflammatory bowel disease AND Reactive arthritis”) incorporating Boolean operators (AND/OR/NOT). Data screening and selection were carried as part of the manual curation through primary and secondary screening scrutinizing collected data records to obtain organized records relevant for the autoimmune and enteric disorders triggered by microorganisms, especially IBD and ReA and the microbial triggers implicated in IBD and ReA that were utilised for further metabolic network reconstruction.

# Metabolic network reconstruction, simulation analysis and data filtering.

A constrained based bottom-up approach consisting of draft reconstruction and manual reconstruction refinement was followed to create metabolic networks of obtained target microorganisms. Genome-scale Metabolic models Simulation, Reconstruction and Visualization (GEMSiRV) software that includes reciprocal Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) of target microorganisms against a template metabolic network of its phylogenetic neighbour and incorporates information from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Transport DB was used for creating draft reconstructs. The manual curation of missing links or gaps in the draft reconstruct was done by mapping the incomplete information to other databases such as Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) and Integrated relational Enzyme database (IntEnz). This fully connected and annotated network was used for further simulation studies. The metabolic networks thus obtained were visualized using CellDesigner, a tool for modelling and editing biochemical and gene-regulatory networks.

Simulation analysis was carried by converting the metabolic networks obtained into a mathematical model and performing the gene deletion analysis to retrieve essential genes. Model conversion was through generation of stoichiometric based matrixes consisting of reactions (columns) and metabolites (rows) corresponding to respective genes. Upper boundary and lower boundary fluxes i.e. movement of matter across a system were generated for the gene associated reactions and metabolites that was extracted in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) format. The next step was gene deletion analysis done using the Constraint Based Reconstruction and Analysis toolbox (COBRA) that runs in Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB) for finding the essential genes based upon the gene-reaction matrix and boolean relationship between genes and reactions.

The purpose of data filtering is to remove repeats and homologs from essential genes of target microorganisms associated with IBD co-existent ReA. The non-homologous protein sequences corresponding to the essential genes of target microorganisms were extracted from Pathosystems Resource Integration (PATRIC) database. Refinement of protein sequences was further done using Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance (CD-HIT) suite so as to have 60% identity non-repeat sequence tolerance stringency. BLAST-P was further used to remove the homologs from such non-repeats against human database at e-value of 10 –4 to obtain non-homologous protein sequences used for further in-silico analysis.

# Essential host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions.

The host-microbe interactions of the non-homologous proteins for the selected target microorganisms were obtained using Host–pathogen Interaction Database (HPIDB). The host-microbe interactions were visualised using Cytoscape. Simulation analysis (gene essentiality) was done to obtain the essential host proteins interacting with common microbe proteins of microorganisms triggering IBD and ReA utilising the human metabolic model HMR 2, a COBRA compliant metabolic model of human consisting of around 3,765 genes, 8,000 reactions and 3,000 metabolites.

This led to profiling of the common host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions comprehending the complex ‘interspecies communication’ as complex interaction maps, executed using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/proteins (STRING).

# Host-microbe disease network and molecular mimicry studies.

The host-microbe disease network is a multilayered archetype that connects the protein-marker-symptom/disease-drug-pathway associations. The contributions of the microorganisms in the co-evolved IBD and ReA as part of the disease network was created through the interactive maps of the essential host interaction proteins (verified using literature survey) and the information processed through gene expression data analysis. The information patronised here is mostly scored through the available non-specific protein diagnostic markers of both IBD and ReA e.g. C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Interleukin 6 (IL6) and Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class I, B (HLA-B) and Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II, DR Beta 1 (HLA-DRB1) with the essential host proteins determined using STRING. Database GeneCards was used to assess the role of these interacting partners aka proteins further with symptoms/diseases associated with IBD and ReA. The pathways of the above host interacting proteins were found out using KEGG database that provides ontologies for proteins related to biological processes.
