# Additional genes involved in iron acquisition

Additional genes involved in iron acquisition could be adaptive for colonization of the IBD gut because anemia is common in patients with IBD [24]. Two of these gene families were annotated as iron ABC transporters and the third as an enterochelin esterase, which makes iron chelated by siderophores available for use.

Previous studies have reported that some strains of R. gnavus utilize mucosal glycans. We found an IBD-specific gene involved in sialic acid transport, which may improve the efficiency of mucus utilization [25]. Thirteen IBD-specific gene families are involved in sugar utilization, including glycoside hydrolases and sugar transporters, which may allow for utilization of an expanded repertoire of sugars as carbon sources (Additional file 8: Table S7).

Finally, one IBD-specific gene is annotated as a lantipeptide synthetase which is involved in the biosynthesis of modified peptides, many of which have antimicrobial effects. Some strains of R. gnavus are known to produce the lantipeptide ruminococcin A, which inhibits the colonization of Clostridium species [26]. Lantipeptides could thus provide R. gnavus a competitive advantage in colonizing the gut.

The IBD-specific genes are likely evidence for collective adaption to the IBD gut by R. gnavus strains. The fact that nine of the genes are associated with mobile elements such as transposase, phage tail tape measure, or relaxosome proteins indicates that many of these genes were likely “cargo genes” of mobile genetic elements acquired by R. gnavus (Additional file 8: Table S7). Thus, the IBD-specific genes are not “core” genes for clade 2, but likely have been acquired and retained because they collectively provide an adaptive advantage in the microenvironment of the IBD gut.

# Discussion

The results presented here are concordant with the hypothesis that a major feature of the dysbiosis of the gut microbiome in IBD is a shift towards organisms that can cope with increased oxidative stress [27]. Importantly, resistance to oxidative stress is widely, yet sparsely, distributed throughout the gut microbiome phylogeny. It is thus not well addressed by simple taxonomic binning.

The microbial shift towards facultative anaerobes has several important implications for the pathophysiology of IBD. We found that the strongest, yet transient, deviation in the microbial composition of IBD patients was the bloom of R. gnavus from an average of 0.1% in our controls to up to 69% in IBD patients with active disease. The physiologic niche of R. gnavus is likely mucolytic (utilizing glycans from the intestinal mucus layer as energy sources). We speculate that the dramatic change in R. gnavus abundance affects the delicate equilibrium of the mucus layer, due to the dramatic increase in the fraction of the community utilizing the mucus layer. This disequilibrium could in turn influence the gut barrier integrity, potentially increasing the intestinal permeability of IBD patients.

Whether the increased abundance of R. gnavus in IBD is a cause or effect of inflammation is currently unknown. At the very least, R. gnavus is a superlative colonizer of the inflamed IBD gut. However, it is also possible that R. gnavus contributes to or exacerbates the excessive immune response to the gut microbiome in IBD patients. In addition to its increased abundance in IBD, other studies have implicated R. gnavus as a potential pathobiont. Three cases of R. gnavus bacteremia and a case of infection of the bone surrounding a hip implant by R. gnavus have been reported [28–30]. In a study about treating UC patients with fecal microbiome transplants, patients who received stool from donors with high R. gnavus were more likely to relapse [31], suggesting a causal role in disease. Denser sampling of patients prior to flares, during their treatment, and after remission will enable the field to further examine the role of R. gnavus in IBD disease activity.

The original misclassification of R. gnavus, combined with 16S amplicon sequencing limitations for species-level identification, have confounded analysis in previous IBD studies, and left the significance of R. gnavus in the dysbiosis of IBD underappreciated. R. gnavus, a member of the phylum Firmicutes, is present in the gut of ~ 90% individuals (though at low abundance). Yet its genus classification has been recently disputed. Originally classified as a member of the Ruminococcus genus by Moore et al. [21], it has been recently transferred to the Blautia genus based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing [32, 33]. Specifically, true Ruminococcus species have decreased abundance in IBD patients, masking the increased abundance of R. gnavus in these samples, when examined only at the genus level.

# Conclusions

One major advantage of this study is that the coupling of longitudinal samples with whole metagenome sequencing has allowed us to study the IBD gut microbiome at the unprecedented resolution of strains and their functional potential. The accurate species- and strain-level identification afforded by whole metagenome sequencing is especially critical in understanding the abundance of R. gnavus, as 16S rRNA gene sequences from Blautia species are highly similar and most 16S analysis has therefore summarized at genus Blautia. Specifically, in IBD, the abundance of different Blautia species change in the opposite direction, completely masking R. gnavus blooms. We used the metagenomic sequencing to go beyond taxonomic profiling and study the functional differences among various R. gnavus strains. Taken together, our results reveal a clade of R. gnavus strains that may be better adapted to the IBD gut, through mechanisms of oxidative stress responses, adhesion, iron acquisition, and mucus utilization.
