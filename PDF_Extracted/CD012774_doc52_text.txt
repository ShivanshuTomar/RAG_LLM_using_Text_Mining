# Interventions

|Experimental arm|Control arm|
|---|---|
|n = 38 • Single donor feces • 50 g stool in 300 mL mixture; 50 mL treatments administered via enema once per week for 6 weeks|n = 37 • Placebo consisting of water • 50 mL treatments administered via enema once per week for 6 weeks|

# Outcomes

Primary outcome

- Clinical remission at week 7 (full Mayo score &lt; 3, Endoscopic Mayo score = 0)

Secondary outcomes

- Clinical response at week 7 (reduction in full Mayo score ≥ 3 points)
- Improvement in UC symptoms (defined as ≥ 3 improvement in full Mayo score)
- Full Mayo score
- IBDQ scores (mean values reported without SD)
- Inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP)
- Adverse events

# Notes

The study was stopped early due to futility.

Data interpretation: study authors reported that all analyses were conducted on an ITT basis, which considered all participants originally randomized to each group even though not every participant completed the trial. They also reported that the IBDQ data had missing values, which were imputed using their means. However, because the IBDQ means for each group were reported without SD values, we excluded this study from the corresponding analysis.

Data extraction: data for ESR and CRP were given for a subset of participants and were used accordingly. We also think that Table 2 of the published manuscript reported SD for continuous outcomes and not SE. The continuous data in Table 1 were reported as mean and SD and when we converted the SE values in Table 2 to SD using the formula SE × √(n) = SD, the values obtained were implausible. Therefore, we extracted the data reported in Table 2 of the published manuscript as SD values. We also wrote to the authors to clarify these data.
