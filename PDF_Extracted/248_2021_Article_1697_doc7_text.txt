# Oral Microbiome

Though UC is generally limited to the colon, CD can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, and can include involvement of the oral cavity, with approximately 40% of a cohort of Irish paediatric CD patients (over a 3 year period) having oral involvement [81]. A significant decrease in diversity was seen in tongue samples of paediatric CD patients when compared to healthy and though non-significant, a decrease was also seen in the buccal samples of these paediatric CD patients [82]. Tongue samples in CD also showed a decrease in Fusobacteria and Firmicutes, but no phylum changes were observed in the buccal samples [82]. No difference in diversity was observed in UC patients in the tongue or buccal samples when compared with healthy, but certain bacterial changes were observed in tongue samples, namely a decrease in Fusobacteria and increased levels of Spirochaetes, Synergistetes, and Bacteroidetes [82]. As previously mentioned, increased numbers of oral bacteria have been observed in the gut of IBD vs healthy individuals, and in IBD patients with increased disease severity. This could suggest that an invasion of oral bacteria to the gut may contribute to part of the dysbiosis observed.

# Conclusion

Paediatric IBD is a lifelong condition (currently with no medical cure) and can have a severe impact on the quality of life of those suffering from the disease. The incidence and prevalence of paediatric IBD is rising, for both CD and UC, and the prevalence is particularly high in industrialised countries. The aetiology of IBD is unknown though it is thought that there is a genetic element, as well as environmental risks, such as industrialisation, and a western lifestyle. The microbiome is also believed to contribute to the risk of developing IBD.

Studies have also shown that both CD and UC have microbiomes that are significantly different from healthy individuals and it is clear from the literature that the microbiome and IBD have a varied and complex relationship. There is some disagreement on whether the healthy paediatric microbiome is identical to the adult microbiome, with arguments on both sides. However, both adult and paediatric IBD exhibit significant differences between disease and healthy controls. There is a decrease in bacterial diversity seen in the guts of IBD patients compared to controls. A number of bacteria, particularly commensals, have been reduced in paediatric IBD compared with controls, such as the Bifidobacterium genus and those in the Firmicutes phylum, such as those from the genera Eubacterium, Ruminococcaceae, and Clostridium. Escherichia coli and various oral bacteria, such as Veillonellaceae, Fusobacterium, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae appear to be increased in paediatric IBD.

Significant differences in microbial composition are evident in the different disease states and disease severity levels, like oral cavity bacteria (such as Haemophilus parainfluenzae) which were found to be increased with disease severity. Possible future research in this area may focus on whether the bacterial changes seen with increased disease severity are an outcome of the worsening disease or if the bacteria have the potential to be contributing to the changes in disease state or severity.

Treatments for IBD appear to have at least some impact on the microbiome, whether that is an intentional effect or a by-product of treatment. Antibiotics have been found to increase dysbiosis in both paediatric CD and UC, and microbes associated with disease severity have also been linked to antibiotic usage by studies. Both 5-ASAs and corticosteroids have been linked to changes in the microbiome and biological therapies such as anti-TNF may be linked to decreases in Firmicutes. Diet therapy, such as EEN, is extensively used as a treatment in paediatric CD. EEN was found to move paediatric CD patients closer to a healthy control microbiome in some studies, but to a distinct pattern of microbiota in others, and some bacteria were also reported to be changed with EEN therapy. An emerging diet therapy, CDED, was found to have similar microbiome changes as EEN treatment (such as Proteobacteria decreases). The CDED study shows promise for dietary treatments in paediatric patients without resorting to an entirely enteral diet.

Investigation of the oral microbiome is also worth considering as up to 40% of paediatric CD patients in one study had oral involvement. Decreases in diversity were found in tongue samples from paediatric CD, and both CD and UC had decreased Fusobacteria in tongue samples when compared to controls. Given the number of studies identifying oral bacteria in the gut of paediatric IBD patients, research into whether the oral bacteria may be invading the gut and contributing to the dysbiosis observed may be a future area of interest.

Less well studied, but a potential future area of interest are the other gut biomes in IBD: the virome and the mycobiome. The virome in IBD is a relatively unexplored area of research, and some disparity exists between the results so far, such as the possibility of increased Caudovirales in IBD. Though currently not extensively explored, a number of studies suggest that there may be significant changes in the mycobiome of IBD patients, and that fungal microbes may be more abundant in CD. Increased Basidiomycota has been reported in paediatric IBD patients, as well as increased abundances of species such as Cyberlindnera jadinii and Candida albicans.

Research into the paediatric IBD microbiome over the last number of years has yielded a large amount of new knowledge about the role microorganisms may play in the aetiology and pathology of CD and UC. These studies have great clinical significance and the accumulation of this knowledge is essential to gain a deeper understanding of the development and
