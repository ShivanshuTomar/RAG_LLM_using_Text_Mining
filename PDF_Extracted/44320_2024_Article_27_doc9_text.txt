in modules 10 and 85 was due to perturbed microbial activity in IBD. Toward this, we profiled the abundances of these features in the fecal metabolomes of germ-free (GF) as compared with specified pathogen-free (SPF) mice using the HILIC-positive LC–MS method (11 of the 15 prioritized features were initially quantified by the same method; Datasets EV9 and EV10, “Methods”). Six features derived from human IBD profiles—including stercobilin—could be mapped to features detected in the GF and SPF mouse stool metabolomes. As expected, stercobilin was very significantly enriched in SPF mice relative to GF (Fig. 4F). More interestingly, two additional features [HILp_QI22686 (m/z = 639.3403 [M + H]+) and HILp_QI21470 (m/z = 611.3453 [M + H]+) were also significantly enriched in SPF mice (Fig. 4F), supporting their microbial origin and thus the ability of MACARRoN to prioritize novel candidate bioactives that are both phenotypically linked and microbiome-derived.

# Nicotinamide riboside validated to ameliorate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis

Pantothenate (vitamin B5) in module 239 was significantly depleted and highly prioritized in both CD-dysbiosis (priority score = 0.7459) and UC (priority score = 0.7455) (Fig. 4B). The other B vitamin in the same module, nicotinate (vitamin B), was also significantly depleted3 in both disease subtypes but moderately-prioritized (in the 75th percentile of priority scores) only in UC (Fig. 5A). In addition to these two vitamin standards, several metabolic features in module 239 were also significantly depleted in CD-dysbiosis and UC (Figs. 3A and 5A), suggesting perturbation of vitamin metabolism during dysbiosis. Nicotinate is a precursor in the gut microbiome mediated synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) via the salvage pathway (Shats et al, 2020) (Fig. 5B). Recent studies show that intestinal nicotinate and NAD+ levels can be boosted with oral nicotinamide riboside (NR); this process requires gut microbial deamidation (via nicotinamidase pncA) of nicotinamide (from NR) to nicotinate and assimilation of the nicotinate moiety into NAD+ (Chellappa et al, 2022). An unannotated feature in the same module—HILp_QI6481 was identified to be NR by matching its m/z, RT, and fragmentation with the NR standard (Fig. EV3). This observed covariance of NR with nicotinate confirms the biochemical coupling between them in the gut and also, once again, underscores MACARRoN’s ability to identify substrate–product relationships from covariance.

We first inspected the gene abundances (specifically, effect sizes for dysbiosis versus nondysbiosis) of microbial enzymes catalyzing de novo (Gazzaniga et al, 2009; Kurnasov et al, 2003) and NR-salvage (Bieganowski and Brenner, 2004; Shats et al, 2020) based synthesis of NAD+. Enzymes involved in both synthesis routes were depleted during dysbiosis (Fig. 5C). Here, the depletion of nicotinamidase genes (pncA) from several species is particularly notable since it explains the depletion of their product—nicotinate, during dysbiosis and thereby, its prioritization by MACARRoN. Taken together, these observations pointed towards decreased gut microbiome-dependent synthesis of NAD+ in IBD. The salvage pathway found in the host recruits the highly conserved NR kinase (NRK) enzymes that phosphorylate NR to nicotinamide mono-nucleotide (NMN), which is then converted to NAD+ by NMNAT2 (Bieganowski and Brenner, 2004). NRK transcription remained unchanged in IBD (Fig. 5D), however, NR salvage via NRK is insufficient to increase the intestinal NAD+ levels (Chellappa et al, 2022). Instead, host cells also rely on microbially provided nicotinate to synthesize NAD+ (Chellappa et al, 2022).

In addition to its role as a coenzyme, NAD+ plays an important role in the regulation of inflammatory and immune processes (Rajman et al, 2018). Therapeutic benefit from the supplementation of NAD+ precursors such as NR and NMN has been observed in inflammation-related and gastrointestinal disorders such as obesity (Canto et al, 2012), diabetes (Yoshino et al, 2011), liver fibrosis (Pham et al, 2019), and age-related colonic dysmotility (Zhu et al, 2017). NR supplementation not only replenishes the NAD+ metabolome but also reduces levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines (Elhassan et al, 2019). Given these previous findings, the covariance between NR and nicotinate, and MACARRoN’s prioritization of nicotinate in IBD, we asked whether NR itself had bioactivity in IBD using two preclinical models of intestinal injury and inflammation, acute and chronic DSS. In the acute model (Fig. 5E), we observed a modest and statistically significant improvement in histological colitis scoring for NR (1000 mg/kg) as compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) administered intraperitoneally (two-tailed Mann–Whitney P value = 0.014, Fig. 5F). In the chronic model (Fig. 5G), which endeavors to capture the relapsing and remitting nature of IBD via repeat exposure to DSS, the difference in colitis scores between the PBS and NR groups was again significant and even more pronounced (two-tailed Mann–Whitney P value = 0.007, Fig. 5H). Collectively, these results validate both the prioritization of nicotinate and bioactivity of NR in IBD and, additionally, demonstrate MACARRoN’s utility to locate potential bioactives (NR) in large datasets by virtue of their covariance with prioritized, well-characterized metabolites (nicotinate).

# Discussion

Although untargeted metabolomics is routinely used to profile the chemical repertoires of microbial communities, most chemical features identified by such methods are difficult or impossible to identify, requiring substantial effort to prioritize and validate. This is true even for metabolomes of well-studied environments, such as the human gut, where the microbiome catabolizes or produces health-relevant metabolites. Here, we present a framework for prioritizing the most promising and actionable metabolites from among thousands of features in untargeted metabolomes associated with phenotypes of interest. We applied this method (MACARRoN) to ~67k metabolic features derived from IBD and control populations, finding associations indicating potential biochemical or functional relationships between ~500 known, gut-relevant metabolites and 15,481 unannotated metabolic features. Prioritization highlighted both well-characterized—e.g., bile acid and SCFA derivatives—and modestly explored classes of metabolites such as polyamines, bilirubins, and vitamins. Altogether, this provides information to initially characterize nearly 23% of the gut metabolome. Finally, we annotated and validated anti-inflammatory activity of nicotinamide riboside in IBD, providing an end-to-end demonstration of MACARRoN’s ability to find compelling candidates for downstream characterization from complex untargeted metabolomes.

Data integration for microbial community metabolomics can thus provide both candidate bioactive leads in phenotypes
