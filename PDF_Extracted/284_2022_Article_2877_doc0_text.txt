# Abstract

Inflammatory bowel disease could be induced by SARS-CoV-2, involved in alteration of gut microbiota during the respiratory viral infection. Presence of viral RNA in fecal samples for longer period, even after the clearance of the virus from respiratory tract, is suggestive of dysbiosis leading to the poor prognosis of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. Gut microbiome (GM) plays a significant role to stimulate the modulated antiviral immune response against invading pathogens regulating the physiological homeostasis. GM profile of COVID-19 patients has revealed the drastic depletion of dominant families of commensals in the gut such as, Bacteroidaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae to be replaced with Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Serratia etc. Immune dysfunction of Th1–Th17 cells along gut-lung axis impairs the mucosal lining translocating the microorganisms including commensals and metabolites to other body organs like lungs, brain, kidney through circulation. These events may cause hyper inflammations associated with excessive secretion of cytokines and chemokines to form the cytokine storm causing ARDS. Gut virome could interact with microbiome and immune cells, help establishing the antiviral immune signaling, important for health maintenance/ or in disease progression. Essentially, these immunological strategies are needed to use in future prospective therapeutics to control the severity events.
