Patterns of gene-level co-abundance across all microbiome samples from a subset of CAGs. Each row represents a single microbial gene, each column represents a single biological sample, and pixel color reflects the gene’s relative abundance (sequencing depth) in the sample. A subset of CAGs and genes was randomly selected for display from the CRC datasets (a) and the IBD datasets (b). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to group the rows and columns, and the left-hand color bar indicates the CAG assignment for each gene.

“discovery” cohort and to use that dataset to build a de novo catalog of microbial genes and identify CAGs. That gene catalog and CAG grouping generated from the discovery cohort was subsequently used to analyze the additional validation cohorts. Our statistical model was relatively straightforward and used random effects modeling to estimate the difference in the centered log-ratio of the relative abundance of each CAG in the samples from people with and without the disease state (accounting for multiple sampling of some individuals with random effects models). We chose to group together all participants with any form of the disease state, as the criteria for disease classification was not consistent across studies. In this discovery-validation approach, those CAGs which had a q value of < 0.2 in the discovery cohort were subsequently tested in an additional “validation” cohort, and those CAGs which also had a q value < 0.2 in that second step and the same direction of effect were considered to be associated with disease.

We found with this approach that the estimated coefficient of disease status in the set of CAGs associated with disease in the discovery cohort was significantly associated with the estimated coefficient in the validation cohort (Fig. 2a, b; CRC—r = 0.36, p < 2E−16; IBD—r = 0.30, p < 2E−16). Within the set of CAGs that were associated with disease in the discovery dataset, 44.0% and 97.2% were significantly associated in the validation dataset for CRC and IBD, respectively. When performing the same analysis with unclustered gene-level abundances (a single gene randomly selected from each CAG), we found a roughly 20–40% lower correlation between the estimated coefficient of disease status (Fig. 2c, d) and a much lower validation rate of 9.8% and 76.0%, respectively. We believe that this evidence supports the proposed utility of CAGs for detecting reproducible biological associations of the microbiome with host disease. Furthermore, 24,502/36,871 CRC-associated CAGs had the same sign of the estimated coefficient in the validation cohort as in the discovery cohort (p < 1E−200, see the “Methods” section), and 28,629/31,895 IBD-associated CAGs had the same signed estimated coefficient (p < 1E−200). We further demonstrated the extent of this association by displaying the abundance of the most strongly associated CAGs across a total of three (IBD) or four (CRC) cohorts (Fig. 2e, f), suggesting that this association is not limited to the cohorts selected for discovery and validation. Over and above the claim that the microbiome is associated with disease in both cohorts, we believe that these results indicate that a substantial number of elements of the microbiome that are associated with disease in a given discovery cohort will also be associated with disease in a corresponding validation cohort.

The pattern of association for the IBD datasets was dominated by the 98.5% of CAGs which had a positive coefficient, indicating that they were more abundant in participants without IBD (Fig. 2b).
