# 1. INTRODUCTION

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a non-infectious, chronic, and relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract in which the interactions among immune responses, barrier function, nutrition, and gut microbiome are involved.1–3 CD can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus, with the terminal ileum and perianal regions being the most,4,5 while UC is usually limited to the colon and rectum, especially in the distal colon and rectum.6 Despite differences in diseased parts, these two diseases share partially overlapping pathological and clinical symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, cramping, rectal bleeding, weight loss, spontaneous remission, bloody stool, and relapsing inflammation.7,8

Epidemiological and observational studies indicate that IBD has become a global burden with rapidly increasing incidence and prevalence in both men and women in both industrialized countries and developing countries.9,10 It is urgent to underline the exact pathogenesis of IBD to provide new insights for the prevention or treatment of this disease. Thus, mounting attempts have been made to understand the precise etiologies and pathogenesis of IBD.11 Generally, it is accepted that genetic factors, intestinal microbiota, environmental factors, and immune responses play a key role in the initiation and/or progression of IBD.12,13 Considering that microbiota and environmental factors may interact with genetic elements,14 most identified susceptibility genes are involved in immune responses in the pathogenesis of IBD.15,16 It is more practical to regulate IBD progress by targeting the intestinal microbiota.17–19 Thus, in the current review, we mainly outlined an update of most used IBD mouse models, shifts in composition and functions of intestinal microbiota, and correlation between dysbiosis and IBD.

# 2. COMPOSITION AND FUNCTIONS OF THE INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA

The mammalian gastrointestinal tract serves as a habitat for an enormous and complex community of microorganisms, including fungi, viruses, protozoans, and bacteria, termed as intestinal microbiota.20,21 The community of commensal fungi, also called the mycobiota, is composed of 66 fungal genera and 184 fungal species in gastrointestinal tract of healthy individuals.22 The number and abundance of fungi in the lower gastrointestinal tract is orders of magnitude smaller than that of bacteria.23 Based on descriptive data in humans and mechanistic data in mice, recent insights have demonstrated that gut mycobiota are not only altered in gastrointestinal diseases such as IBD but also play a key role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and modulating immune response.24,25 Furthermore, growing evidence reported that gut fungi in patients with IBD contribute to the aggravation of the inflammatory response, leading to increased disease severity.22,25 Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of gut mycobiota contributing to IBD remains incompletely understood. Understanding the interaction among fungi, bacteria, and host immune response will help address the contribution of the mycobiota in IBD and develop novel approaches for protection and/or manage gastrointestinal disease.22,26

Prokaryotic viruses (bacteriophages) and eukaryotic viruses in the gut together are termed as gut virome that is recognized as an essential part of the gut microbiome and play a vital role in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases.27 Accordingly, enteric viruses are strongly related to intestinal inflammation evidenced by gut virome enriched from non-IBD, and noninflamed colon resections display anti-inflammatory effects.28 Furthermore, a significant difference in virome between IBD patients and healthy individuals was observed.29 Notably, the changes in virome composition reflected alterations in bacterial composition among IBD subjects, indicating interactions between enteric virus and intestinal bacteria.30,31 Although viruses have been reported to be associated with IBD, mounting analyses are still needed to explore the accurate role of virus in the molecular pathogenesis of IBD because of the very limited literature, currently. Data regarding protozoans in IBD were omitted because of limited studies. Bacterial microbiota has always been the most abundant and studied component among the four intestinal microbial flora,32,33 which is composed of 100 trillion microbial organisms, forming the essential part of the microbiota ecosystem.34,35 The whole bacteria in the intestine comprise approximately 1000 species, most of which belong to the dominant phyla of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria,36,37 and other less are classified into Verrucomicrobia, Fusobacteria, and Cyanobacteria phyla.38 The intestinal microbiota is less diverse at birth and develops into a highly complex one as it interacts more with diets,39,40 which contain nutrients required for the symbiotic bacteria, pathogens, exogenous antigens, and toxins. In another aspect, the bacteria also exhibit differences both from mucosal to luminal and proximal to distal gradients along the whole intestine,41 displaying substantial variations among individuals.42 Here we comprehensively elucidate the alterations in the gut microbiota (intestinal bacteria) in IBD to provide crucial insight into investigation of the IBD pathogenesis.

The gut microbiota of healthy individuals has been reported to live in a symbiotic relationship and co-evolve with the host by providing crucial physiological functions, including nutrient digestion and absorption, development of the intestinal immune system, and host defense against exogenous pathogens.43 Some bacteria of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla are capable of fermenting resistant starch or indigestible carbohydrates to generate short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are major energy sources for the colonic epithelium and are reported to stimulate cell proliferation.44,45 Other bacteria, such as Bacteroides, also participate in carbohydrate metabolism through degrading glycosyl transferases, glycoside hydrolases, and polysaccharide lyases.46 Furthermore, it has also been reported that the intestinal microbiota is vital for lipid metabolism by activating lipoprotein lipase activity.47,48 In addition, the gut microbiota metabolizes protein via its proteinases and peptidases in coordination with the host. Then, amino acid transporters, which are located at the cell wall, facilitate the entry of amino acids into the...
