# REVIEW SERIES: INTERACTIONS OF THE MICROBIOTA WITH THE MUCOSAL IMMUNE SYSTEM

# Immune mechanisms of FMT in UC

showed a positive correlation between CD4 + T cell pro- duction of IFN-γ from rectal mucosal biopsies and the relative abundance of total gut viral reads, specifically the bacteriophage Caudiovirales [94]. They found that this bacteriophage was significantly enriched in patients who failed to respond to FMT. Mechanistically, they demonstrated that introduction of Lactobacillus, Escherichia and Bacteroides bacteriophages into GF mice led to immune cell expansion and stimulated IFN-γ via the nucleotide-sensing receptor TLR-9 in the gut.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) targeting CTLA-4, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) has been shown to improve survival among numerous cancer types by increasing T cell activation and driving an effective anti-tumour immune response. A common adverse reaction associated with ICI is colitis, which can be quite severe and resemble that seen in IBD. A case report of two patients with steroid and biologic refractory ICI-associated colitis demonstrated a successful response with FMT [95]. These patients had an increased abundance of pathogenic Gammaproteobacteria and a notable absence of potentially protective Bacteroidia. This immunological response after FMT was associated with a substantial reduction in the colonic mucosal CD8+ T cell density and increase in FoxP3+ CD4 cells. There was a concomitant expansion in the population of Clostridia and Blautia. There was also an increase in Bifidobacterium species following FMT, and this was recently reported to abrogate ICI-related toxicity in a murine model [96]. In this study, mice with DSS-induced colitis and anti-CTLA-4 blockade treatment with Bifidobacterium ameliorated colitis. This protective effect was abrogated in Treg-depleted mice. Collectively, these findings indicate an emerging role of FMT and specific agents in the gut microbiota in mitigating inflammation via induction or modulation of Treg function.

It is clear that immunological outcomes have been poorly explored in clinical FMT studies in IBD, with studies focusing primarily on gut microbial analysis. Nevertheless, these analyses have provided valuable indirect insights into microbial interactions that potentially modulate immune-mediated inflammatory responses. Gut microbiota profiles in FMT responders consistently show a significant shift towards butyrate-producing species of bacteria that are known to induce Tregs and promote IL-10 production [67,68]. Rossen and colleagues reported that at 12 weeks of follow-up, the microbiota of responders in the FMT group was similar to that of their healthy donors and remission was associated with proportions of Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa [97]. The FOCUS trial conducted by Paramsothy and colleagues reported that increased abundances of species belonging to Clostridium clusters XIVa and XVIII, such as R. intestinalis, were associated with positive outcomes following FMT [98,99]. Furthermore, members of Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa in the Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families were significantly enriched in stool of a donor (donor B) who was associated with the highest rate of response following FMT in recipients in the study conducted by Moayyedi and colleagues [100]. In the analysis of mechanistic outcomes from this study, a trend was seen for responders having microbiota that was more similar to donor B than non-responders.

# Immunological mechanistic insights for FMT in IBD using animal studies

Immune responses to FMT have been explored in a few studies using IBD and non-IBD mouse models. Functional effects of therapeutic FMT administration during experimental colitis on innate and adaptive immune responses in the intestinal mucosa were explored in a pivotal study [101]. Mucus and faeces derived from normobiotic mice were gavaged into CXCR6EGFP+ reporter mice (for fluorescent T cell tracking) with DSS-induced colitis, resulting in reduction of intestinal inflammation and histological inflammation scores compared to control DSS-colitis mice. FMT-treated DSS-colitis mice demonstrated higher amounts of colonic IL-10 as well as increased frequencies of IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells and invariant NK T cells (iNK T) in comparison to control DSS-treated mice. FMT treatment was also associated with a reduction of macrophages and neutrophils, together with a non-significant increase in the frequency of FoxP3+ Treg cells. Intriguingly, this increase in IL-10 secretion by T cells normalized upon resolution of inflammation. Pharmacological blockade of IL-10 receptor hampered the protective effects of FMT, suggesting a direct contribution of the microflora in IL-10-mediated control of inflammation. Furthermore, there was a decrease in innate lymphocytes ILC2 and ILC3, macrophages and neutrophils in the lamina propria in FMT-treated DSS-colitis mice. FMT induced a significant reduction in the number and level of expression of colonic MHC-II-expressing antigen-presenting cells (APC) (including dendritic cells and macrophages). LPMC exposed to FMT-derived microbiota showed reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IFN-γ. Camp and S100A8, two anti-microbial peptides playing anti-inflammatory roles during acute intestinal inflammation, were up-regulated upon FMT administration. Gut microbiota analysis of FMT-treated mice showed significant increases of commensals, including species belonging to Lactobacillaceae and Streptococcus, together with the SCFA-producing taxa Erysipelotrichaceae and Ruminococcaceae. This instrumental work demonstrated the beneficial anti-inflammatory effect mediated by FMT in modifying immune cell frequencies, reduction of proinflammatory colonic IFN-γ and IL-1β, increase in specific anti-microbial.
