FIGURE 4. Independent samples t-test showing responders (R=blue) and primary non-responders (P=purple) with statistically significant P values in Pediococcus (*P< 0.034983), Proteus (*P< 0.040331), Shigella (*P< 0.010478), Roseburia (*P< 0.04166), Flexispira (*P< 0.034983), and Klebsiella (*P< 0.016427).

Lachnospira, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus. By contrast, some SCFA-producing bacteria showed an increase in relative abundance in primary non-responders, such as Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Lachnobacterium, Odoribacter, Oscillospira, and Pseudoramibacter eubacterium. An increased diversity of several pathogenetic gut microbiota was observed in primary non-responders, including Enterococcus, Fusobacterium (adherent-invasive bacteria), Clostridium, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Actinomyces, Corynebacterium, Rothia, Rhodococcus, Atopobium, Listeria, Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium, Campylobacter, Flexispira, Morganella, Actinobacillus, Selenomonas, Haemophilus, Acinetobacter, and Klebsiella. Furthermore, a great abundance of opportunistic pathogens such as Muribaculaceae, Proteus, Odoribacter, Alistipes, Veillonella, and Pseudomonas was recorded in fecal samples of primary non-responders. An independent t-test showed a statistically significant association (p < 0.05) for six genera and seven species [Figure 4]. These results suggest that primary non-responders to anti-TNF-α treatment possess a type of unstable gut microbiota structure.

# Alpha and beta diversity

The alpha diversity was measured in observed species (Sobs) (p = 0.79118), using the Chao1 estimator (p = 0.63053), ACE (p = 0.57874), Shannon diversity (p = 0.79594), and Simpson diversity (p = 0.63053) indices [Figure S4 and Table S1]. In general, in terms of alpha diversity, there was no significant difference in relative abundance between responders and primary non-responders [Figure 5 and Table S2].

The beta diversity analysis was estimated using the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity, for unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances Figure S5. These tools showed that the composition of intestinal microbiota of primary non-responders overall shifted toward dysbiosis compared with responders. Principal coordinate analysis and 2D-weighted UniFrac showed a significant overlap between the gut microbiota structure of responders and primary non-responders [Figure 6A and B]. The weighted UniFrac heat map was used to determine the intestinal microbiota profile distances in IBD patients, between responders and non-responders. The microbial community composition of primary non-responders showed the proportion of change (disorder) compared with responders.
