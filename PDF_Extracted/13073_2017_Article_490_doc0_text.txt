# Abstract

Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that is associated with changes in the gut microbiome. Here, we sought to identify strain-specific functional correlates with IBD outcomes.

Methods: We performed metagenomic sequencing of monthly stool samples from 20 IBD patients and 12 controls (266 total samples). These were taxonomically profiled with MetaPhlAn2 and functionally profiled using HUMAnN2. Differentially abundant species were identified using MaAsLin and strain-specific pangenome haplotypes were analyzed using PanPhlAn.

Results: We found a significantly higher abundance in patients of facultative anaerobes that can tolerate the increased oxidative stress of the IBD gut. We also detected dramatic, yet transient, blooms of Ruminococcus gnavus in IBD patients, often co-occurring with increased disease activity. We identified two distinct clades of R. gnavus strains, one of which is enriched in IBD patients. To study functional differences between these two clades, we augmented the R. gnavus pangenome by sequencing nine isolates from IBD patients. We identified 199 IBD-specific, strain-specific genes involved in oxidative stress responses, adhesion, iron-acquisition, and mucus utilization, potentially conferring an adaptive advantage for this R. gnavus clade in the IBD gut.

Conclusions: This study adds further evidence to the hypothesis that increased oxidative stress may be a major factor shaping the dysbiosis of the microbiome observed in IBD and suggests that R. gnavus may be an important member of the altered gut community in IBD.

# Background

IBD is associated with increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), causing oxidative stress for both host cells and the gut microbiome [2–4]. Additionally, the gut microbiome in IBD shows dysbiosis characterized by increased abundance of functional pathways involved in the microbial response to oxidative stress [5]. However, the species and/or strains of microbes that contribute to this functionality remain unclear.

The increased availability of whole metagenome sequencing, as opposed to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, has provided the opportunity to study the taxonomic composition of microbiomes at unprecedented resolution.
