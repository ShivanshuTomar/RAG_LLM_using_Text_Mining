# Association of Gut Microbiota with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and COVID‑19 Severity: A Possible…

# Innate Immune Response and Microbiota

Lymphocytes regulate the immune surveillance & defense, and goblet cells synthesize the functional mucosal layer in gut. Naïve T-cells differentiated into Th1 and Th17 to raise pro-inflammatory response by pathogens. Epithelial injuries occur by systemic endotoxemia translocating the bacterial components; causing the immune imbalance and systemic inflammation to establish ‘hypercytokinemia’ and dysbiosis. Lymphocytopenia and exhausted T-cells increase the secretion of IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, TNFα, GCSF, MIP-1, MCP-1 and 10 kD IFN- IP10, in severe infection. The plausible role of microflora in dictating dysbiosis, inflammation and susceptibility to SARS CoV-2 infection is outlined in Figs. 1 and 2.

GF mice have the reduced Lymphocytes (Αβ and γδ) and no immunomodulator cells VIZ. IL-17 + CD4 + T-cells; Th T-17 in lamina propria; which could induce T-cells (Th 1, Th2) production, if they are colonized with filamentous bacteria. Bacteroides fragilis polysaccharide regulates the T and B-cell lineage, involving the induction of all antibodies. The activation of the innate immune receptors like, TLR5/or NOD are mediated by the counter selection of the flagellin.

The hyperglycosylated mucin-2 layer (MUC2) regulates the immune system and help translocate the enteric DCs towards anti-inflammatory state.

IgA antibodies and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to present the mucosal barrier function. Enteric DCs play a significant role by presenting the enteric bacterial antigens to the enteric cells. AMPs interact with microbiota many times and contribute to maintain homeostasis by pancreas acini. Reduction in cathelicidin AMPs of pancreas lack the calcium channel regulator ‘Orai 1’; which eventually cause the spread of microbes and subsequent inflammation via activated T-cells.

Commensals produce PRRs and TLRs to induce the protective immunity and TLR-5 shaping the microbiota constitution. Polysaccharides producing Bacteroides fragilis promotes for symbiont formation and educate the host immune system. TLR1/TLR2 and Dectin-1 signal the downstream activation of PI3K pathway, which inactivate the 3β (GSK 3β) inducing the cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein dependent expression of the inflammatory genes. Dectin -1 regulate the Treg differentiation and PRR through NOD like receptors serve as the innate sensor to maintain the intestinal homeostasis.

Modulated innate response generated through MyD88 via IL-1 and IL-18; controls the activation of epithelial cells by AMPs against gram + ve bacteria, thus, balancing the adaptive response. It also regulates the Th17 by activation of T-cells and IgA stimulation. NLRs inflammasomes stimulate pyroptosis through activated IL-1β and IL-18 caspases and microbiota metabolites balance their expression by NLRP6 inflammasome signals. NRLP3 inflammasome in ulcerative colitis engages with IgG and activates the FcγR macrophages to induce IL-1β. Proteus spp. at the time of intestinal injury activate the monocytes to induce NLRP3 IL-1, increasing the inflammation. Peptidoglycan substances through innate system and PRRs are crucial for activating the immune cell health.

Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) generates signals through IL-18, IL-22 and STAT3 pathways to control homeostasis. Synergistic effects NOD2 help control the colitis via signals of IL-18, IL-22 and STAT3 pathway and mammalian peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) to control the colitis by balancing cytotoxic IFNγ produced by NK cells. NOD-LLR family of proteins recognizes the intracellular flagellin protein and also activates the inflammasome, which stimulate capcase-1 and promotes IL-1β in TLR-5 independently in Salmonella infected macrophages. PRRs regulation of host-microbiome symbiosis needs more studies on inducible gene RIG-like receptors and OLRs. DC driven Th1 and Th 17 immunity activates, when Trichomonas musculis protects against the enteric bacterial infection in mice via activation of inflammasomes. Microbiota driven polysaccharides induce anti-inflammatory response in intestinal macrophages in mice. Butyrate can drive monocytes to macrophages differentiation through HDAC3 inhibition through amplifying antimicrobial mechanisms. Trimethylamine N-oxide can drive murine macrophage polarization in an NLRP3 inflammasome dependent manner.

Innate Lymphoid cells (ILCs) help repair the mucosal layer to combat enteric infection and help proliferate Ffar2. In mice model, ILCs with Helicobacter negatively regulate the RORγt. ILCs are important for host immunity and inflammation. Type 3ILC mediates the immune surveillance in microbiota through transcriptional factor ID2 -dependent regulation of IL-22.
