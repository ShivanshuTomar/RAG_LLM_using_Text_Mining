Genera with significant differences between cases and controls, non-responders and responders. a –Log10(p value) from testing difference in abundance of each genus in cases compared to controls and non-responders compared to responders. Blue bars indicate taxa negatively associated with case or non-responder status, and red bars indicate a positive association. The line below 2 represents the threshold for nominal significance; the higher line is the significance level after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple tests. The asterisks denote taxa that also appear in the results of our random forest classifier. b–d Example patterns representative of each of the three categories: b significant in both comparisons, c significant only between cases and controls, and d significant only between non-responders and responders. (See also Additional file 2: Table S6.)

# Populations with varying proportions of responders.

The confusion matrix for the subsampled model can be found in Additional file 2: Table S8; the ROC and precision-recall curves can be found in Additional file 2: Figure S5. Importantly, 14 of the top 15 most important genera identified are identical between the weighted and equal sampling analyses (Additional file 2: Table S10), supporting the conclusion that these taxa are truly responsible for separating responders and non-responders in our cohort. Replication in a larger study will be needed to confirm the role of these taxa in treatment response.

The abundances of genera with the top 15 highest variable importance scores in our weighted random forest (listed with importance scores in Additional file 2: Table S9) are shown in Fig. 4b. Additional file 2: Figure S6 shows stacked bar charts for each sample used in the random forest (categorized by eventual response or non-response) summarizing those of the top 15 genera that were found above 1 % average abundance. Four of the top 15 genera (Coprococcus, Adlercreutzia, Dialister, and an unnamed genus of Enterobacteriaceae) overlapped with our GEE results. This overlap is denoted with asterisks in Fig. 3a and Fig. 4b. Three of these genera were the most significant in our GEE groupings, further implicating their significance in our IBD patients: Coprococcus was the most significant of the genera in both case/control and responder/non-responder comparisons, Adlercreutzia was most significant in the case/control comparisons, and Dialister was the most significant in responder/non-responder comparisons.

Furthermore, Coprococcus and Adlercreutzia were the two genera that remained significant in our case/control analysis (both with decreased abundance) after treatment. Our study was based on longitudinal stool sampling, which was both feasible and robust; microbial dysbiosis improved from baseline but persisted despite complete cessation of clinical disease activity among responders; distinct microbiota signatures emerged among responders compared with non-responders at the genus level, but not dysbiosis index; and treatment-naïve analysis of the microbiome could potentially be used to predict whether a subject will respond to treatment.
