# REVIEW SERIES: INTERACTIONS OF THE MICROBIOTA WITH THE MUCOSAL IMMUNE SYSTEM

The plasticity and adaptability of Th cells based on host environmental factors makes them highly relevant in the development and pathogenesis of IBD. Historically, T cell subsets were described as either Th1 cells that secrete interferon (IFN)-γ, essential for eradication of intracellular pathogens, or Th2 cells that secrete IL-4, -5 and -13 and play an essential role in the response against parasites and the fibrosis process. Consequently, based on cytokine production, CD was traditionally considered to be primarily a Th1 condition and UC was characterized as a Th2-mediated disease. The discovery of IL-17-producing Th17 cells and immunomodulating regulatory T cells (Treg) led to the refinement of this paradigm. Among these subsets of CD4+ T cells, Th17 cells have been shown to have critical roles in mucosal defence and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. These cells, together with expression of IL-17, were shown to be highly enriched in the intestinal lamina propria of patients with IBD.

Patients with IBD have altered abundances and functionality of the different ILC subsets in the gut compared to healthy individuals. Many key genes related to ILC3 (innate counterpart to Th17 cells) biology were identified as IBD risk loci in genomewide association studies (GWAS) and are involved in the IL-23/IL-17 pathway. ILC3 subpopulations have been shown to shape microbial communities by either modifying epithelial function or the functional properties of other cells that influence microbiota composition. Certain tryptophan-based microbial metabolites were shown to directly control functionality of ILC3 through activation of ligand-dependent transcription factors, in particular aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Mice with a deletion of MHC-II in ILC3 developed spontaneous colitis in the presence of commensal bacteria.

# Adaptive immunity

In addition to the initial contact between the environment and immune system through the innate immune pathway, the adaptive immune system also plays a crucial role in the progression of chronic inflammation in IBD. CD4+ T cell subsets play central roles in the formation of cytokine networks in IBD pathogenesis. Seminal work in the early 1990s demonstrated that adoptive transfer of CD4 activating gene (RAG)−/− induced T cells failed to induce colitis in mice (deficient in B and T cells) with reduced bacterial load or raised under GF conditions. Furthermore, CD4 T cells isolated from mice that develop spontaneous colitis were strongly reactive to MHC-II antigens from gut commensals but not to epithelial or food antigens. Adoptive transfer of bacterial antigen-activated CD4+ T cells from these mice into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice was able to induce colitis when activated by gut microbial antigens. These findings suggested that intestinal inflammation is driven by resident gut bacteria.

Patients with IBD have increased expression of Reg proteins, suggestive of compensatory defensive mechanisms against enteric pathogens. A further component of the innate immune response that plays an important role in maintenance of gut mucosal homeostasis and tissue repair includes the family of innate lymphoid cells (ILC). These innate immune cells belong to the lymphoid lineage and have certain functional similarities with the adaptive CD4 T helper (Th) cell populations, but do not possess an antigen-specific T or B cell receptor. Th17 cells are not found in the intestines of GF-reared mice, suggesting that gut bacteria are possibly responsible for generation of this immune subset.

More recently, other human symbiont bacterial species such as Bifidobacterium adolescentis have been shown to drive Th17 differentiation in mice. A breakdown in the homeostatic adaptive immune inflammatory and regulatory mechanisms appears to play a fundamental role in the development of IBD. The development of tolerance to gut commensals is fundamental to the induction and maintenance of a host–microbial mutualistic T cell response, thereby limiting microbe-triggered gut inflammation.

IL-10−/−, IL-2−/− and IL-2R−/− mice that have dysfunctional or reduced Treg frequencies develop colitis and are commonly used models of IBD. Although GF IL-10−/− mice do not develop colitis, introduction of specific strains of bacteria such as Lactobacillus plantarum 299V into specific pathogen-free IL-10−/− mice had a protective effect against the development of colitis, whereas strains of Enterococcus faecalis did not.
