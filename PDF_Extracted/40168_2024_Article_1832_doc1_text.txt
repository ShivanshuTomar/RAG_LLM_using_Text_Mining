disease [12, 13]. These interactions occur within the context of the gut microbiome and the host immune system and are crucial for maintaining gut homeostasis and defending against pathogens [14].

The study of the gut virome predominantly employs two approaches: bulk metagenome sequencing and virus-like particle (VLP) enrichment followed by sequencing. While bulk metagenome analysis has long been used to characterize the entire microbial community (i.e., bacteriome, archaeome, and mycobiome) in the gut [15], its use in predicting viral genomes is relatively recent, with viral reference databases still evolving [16]. In contrast, VLP enrichment-based technology has emerged as a promising tool for studying the gut virome in the past few years [17, 18], yielding a greater proportion of viral sequences and simplifying the identification of viruses in complex microbiota. Nevertheless, VLP enrichment has its challenges, including incomplete databases and potential methodological biases, requiring resolution to enhance the understanding of viral characteristics linked to diseases.

Both VLP and bulk virome approaches have been used to investigate the characteristics of the gut virome in patients with IBD, including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Early VLP-based studies revealed a significant expansion of Caudovirales bacteriophages in CD and UC patients [5]. A subsequent study expanded on this by identifying IBD-specific virome changes and found increased temperate phages in CD patients [19]. Moreover, bulk virome analysis revealed significant alterations in eukaryotic viruses in IBD [20], consistent with findings in children with IBD [21, 22]. Experimental advances have demonstrated that fecal virus-like particles isolated from UC patients exacerbate colitis severity in mice [23], and viromes from IBD colon tissue promote inflammation in mice [24]. However, further research is needed to obtain detailed information about gut viral structural changes and their impact on IBD. Comprehensive technologies and reference databases are essential for the universal and streamlined identification of these associated changes.

In this study, we designed and carried out a virome-wide association study based on VLP and bulk metagenome sequencing and analysis of fecal samples from an IBD patient and healthy control cohort (total n = 148). We established an integrated gut virus catalog tailored to the IBD virome, facilitating the identification of numerous viral signatures. Notably, these signatures displayed remarkable consistency across diverse populations, including those in Europe and the USA. Moreover, we conducted fecal virome transplantation (FVT) experiments using human fecal VLPs in a mouse model, confirming the roles of IBD viral signatures in disease progression. Our findings provide valuable insights into the IBD gut virome, offering a range of reproducible biomarkers with potential implications for prognostic and therapeutic strategies, and establish a framework for exploring virome landscapes in other relevant disorders.

# Results

# Subject characteristics

Our cohort was composed of 71 patients with IBD (including 15 with CD and 56 with UC) and 77 healthy controls. The phenotypic characteristics of all the subjects are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or body mass index (BMI) between IBD patients and healthy controls, and these characteristics did not differ between patients with CD and those with UC. The disease activity of IBD patients was determined by the simplified Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (sCDAI) [25], which revealed that 66.7% of CD patients and 82.1% of UC patients experienced moderate or severe activity periods.

# Gut virome sequencing and virus catalog construction

To characterize IBD virome, we processed and analyzed fecal samples from 148 subjects using VLP metagenomic and bulk metagenomic sequencing technologies (detailed in “Methods”). This generated a total of 462.0 Gbp (VLP clean data, averaging 3.3 ± 1.9 Gbp per sample) and 1.14 Tbp (bulk clean data, average 7.7 ± 5.2 Gbp per sample) of high-quality nonhuman data (Fig. 1a). The metagenomic data of each sample were individually de novo assembled, and the viral sequences (representing > 64,000 candidates for all samples) were identified from these assembled contigs using an integrated pipeline detailed in the “Methods” section, consistent with our prior studies [18, 26, 27]. As a considerable number of viral sequences in this study were potentially fully assembled in other Chinese metagenomes, we incorporated ~ 17,000 viral genomes from the comprehensive Chinese gut virus catalog (cnGVC) [26], which exhibited high similarity and coverage with our current viral candidates. Next, we combined all viral sequences and removed duplicates with > 95% nucleotide identity across > 70% of the sequences, resulting in a catalog of 10,054 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) for subsequent analyses (Supplementary Table 2). Utilizing CheckV [28], it was estimated that the majority (60.6%) of vOTUs possessed complete or high-quality (≥ 90% completeness) genomes, with over 90% of vOTUs showing low contamination (< 10%) (Fig. 1b). Taxonomically, 39.5% and 4.9% of vOTUs could be assigned to known prokaryotic or eukaryotic viral families, respectively, while the remaining vOTUs (55.6% of all vOTUs) remained unclassified at the family level. Consistent with previous studies [18, 19],
