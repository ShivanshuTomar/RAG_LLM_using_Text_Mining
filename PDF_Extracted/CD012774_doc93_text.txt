# Interventions

# Experimental arm

- Colonoscopy + FMT (frozen preparation of 50 g of stools in 300 mL of saline [0.9% sodium chloride]) in terminal ileum or colon
- At weeks 12 and 24 after first colonoscopy: treatment by capsule (15 capsules contain 0.8 g of stools by visit)

# Control arm

- Colonoscopy + sham transplantation (frozen preparation of 0.9% sodium chloride with 10% glycerol) in terminal ileum or colon
- At weeks 12 and 24 after first colonoscopy: treatment by capsule (15 capsules contain placebo)

# Outcomes

# Primary outcome

- Clinical remission (CDAI < 150) at week 52 (V8) without any flare between week 0 (colonoscopy [V2]) and week 52 (V8): flare defined by CDAI (see Addendum 2 in publication) > 250 or 150–250 points with 70-point increase from baseline over 2 consecutive weeks

# Secondary outcomes

- Relapse-free survival at week 52
- Mucosal healing at week 52
- Clinical remission at week 52
- Endoscopic remission at week 52
- Changes in complete blood count at weeks 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 52
- Changes in CRP at weeks 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 52
- Changes in fecal calprotectin at weeks 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 52
- Changes in intestinal microbiota composition at weeks 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 52
