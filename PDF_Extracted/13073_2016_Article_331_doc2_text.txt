# Methods

# Study population

Potential participants were identified from Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta inpatient wards and outpatient pediatric IBD clinics based on clinical suspicion of IBD based on symptoms or lab work. Criteria to participate in the study included CD or UC diagnosis confirmed by colonoscopy and/or magnetic resonance enterography, willingness to participate, and ability to maintain close follow-up. Patients and families gave informed consent and assent to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria included prior diagnosis of IBD, prior therapy with immunomodulators or biologics, or history of non-compliance with clinical appointments.

A total of 19 pediatric IBD cases (≤17 years old, 15 with CD and 4 with UC) were enrolled in this longitudinal prospective study between June 2013 and January 2014. Participants were followed at regular intervals beginning at the time of enrollment until the termination of the study in August 2014. All patients were phenotyped at the time of enrollment according to the Paris Classification [21]. Demographic and phenotypic characteristics were collected via patient interview and chart review at the time of sample delivery, and an abbreviated PCDAI [22–24] or PUCAI was obtained at all clinical visits [25]. Medical treatment was not affected by joining this study. Patients started to receive treatment between their first and second clinical visits. Patients were treated with aggressive mono-therapy of either immunomodulators or biologics with mucosal reassessment via colonoscopy approximately one year after diagnosis. Based on the presence or absence of mucosal healing, we dichotomized patients as responders (n = 6) or non-responders (n = 13), respectively, independent of any knowledge about microbiome composition. Since subjects received multiple treatments, we did not categorize based on the particular treatment exposures. Patients receiving surgery were classified as non-responders, and only presurgery time points were used in analyses. Family members of patients were recruited as related controls (n = 6), and unrelated controls ≤17 years old with no IBD diagnosis were also recruited (n = 4). Once enrolled, participants were followed no more frequently than weekly.

# Specimen collection and processing

Fecal samples were obtained at regular intervals beginning at the time of diagnosis and throughout the study (Fig. 1). Each fecal sample was collected and placed into two separate Para-Pak Vials: one with 100 % ethanol and one without ethanol. The specimen with ethanol was submitted to the study coordinator at room temperature for processing within 24 hours of collection. The specimen was spun down, the ethanol discarded, and the remaining stool was either stored at –20 °C until ready for aliquoting or immediately aliquoted to be stored at –80 °C for fecal microbiome analysis. The specimen without ethanol was stored at –20 °C until it was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C for fecal calprotectin analysis. Fecal calprotectin was measured by Eagle Biosciences Calprotectin Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.

# Bioinformatic processing

In collaboration with the Broad’s Molecular Biology R&D (MBRD) lab, we sequenced the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using the Illumina MiSeq platform according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Reads were demultiplexed into fastq files for each sample using sequence barcodes. Forward and reverse reads were joined with PANDAseq [26]. After samples with fewer than 3000 reads were excluded, there was a median of 66,000 reads per sample used in the study. The joined sequence files were formatted using a Python script to add QIIME headers with the respective sample ID to each sequence before concatenating into one file for input into QIIME 1.8.0 [27]. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were picked using the QIIME pick_closed_reference_otus.py script with a threshold of 97 % identity to the Greengenes v13_8 database. A median of 91 % of reads per sample were classified successfully with this closed-reference OTU approach. The Shannon alpha diversity was calculated on the unfiltered biom table using the alpha_diversity.py script, and weighted UniFrac distances were calculated with the beta_diversity.py script. The microbial dysbiosis index (initially described by Gevers et al. [19]) was calculated in R for each sample. The microbial dysbiosis index is defined as the log 10 of the total abundance in organisms increased in CD divided by the total abundance of organisms decreased in CD. The increased-in-CD taxa comprise Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Fusobacteriaceae, Neisseriaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Gemellaceae. Decreased-in-CD taxa are Bacteroidales, Clostridiales (excluding Veillonellaceae), Erysipelotrichaceae, and Bifidobacteriaceae [19].

To test the robustness of our findings from these Shannon diversity and dysbiosis calculations, we repeated association tests between cases and controls using our data (1) with a de novo OTU clustering approach and (2) by rarefying to an even sequencing depth. Our de novo analysis was performed the same as our original closed-reference analysis with the exception that chimeras were first removed from each sample using USEARCH v6.1.
