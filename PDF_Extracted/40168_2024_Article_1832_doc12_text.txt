# Conclusions

Through integrated VLP and bulk virome studies, we demonstrated a significant disruption in the gut virome of IBD patients and identified 139 IBD-associated vOTUs. Furthermore, we substantiated that these IBD viral signatures can be validated across diverse human population datasets and possess potential modulatory features in regulating disease severity in animal models. This study provides a detailed analysis of the gut virome landscape for IBD, and the results and resources provided may promote future mechanistic and therapeutic work.

# Methods

# Subjects and sample collection

Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Xinhua Hospital affiliated with Dalian University (approval no. XH2020A008), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All subjects involved in this study were recruited from Dalian, Liaoning province, China, and were rigorously screened to exclude individuals with liver diseases, kidney diseases, cardiometabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes, moderate to severe hypertension), and cancers. Additionally, none of the participants had taken antibiotics within 1 month or antiviral drugs within 3 months prior to sample collection. The IBD patients were enrolled with inclusion criteria necessitating a clear diagnosis by a licensed physician in strict accordance with the ECCO-ESGAR Guideline for Diagnostic Assessment in Inflammatory Bowel Disease [64]. The Simplified Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (sCDAI) integrates clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters, medication utilization, and the presence of perianal disease to offer a comprehensive assessment of disease severity. Healthy participants were matched with IBD patients in terms of age, sex, and BMI to ensure consistency in the results. More than 20 g of fresh fecal specimen per individual were collected from both IBD patients and healthy controls, using sterile fecal collection containers. Fecal specimens were collected and transported to the laboratory within 2 h. One portion of the samples was directly frozen at − 80 °C for subsequent NGS sequencing, while another portion was subjected to processing for VLPs enrichment. For the latter, a parallel set of samples was supplemented with glycerol as a protective agent before being frozen at − 80 °C. All samples for VLPs enrichment were stored frozen for less than 1 month before processing.

# VLP enrichment and metagenomic sequencing

The procedures of VLP enrichment, viral DNA extraction, and metagenomic sequencing were conducted following our previously established protocols with minor adjustments [18, 26]. Briefly, 0.17 g of fecal material for each specimen was mixed with 1 mL of Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS, devoid of phenol red) and vigorously homogenized using a vortex mixer (with pulses lasting a minimum of 15 s). Subsequently, the samples underwent centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 ℃. The resulting supernatant was then successively filtered through 0.45-μm and 0.2-μm filters. Afterward, the samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 750,000 × g for 60 min at 8 ℃, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 500 μL of HBSS; 120 μL of this resuspension was transferred and treated with a mixture of nucleases (comprising 2.4 μL of TURBO DNase (4.8 U, Invitrogen), 8 μL of RNase A/T1 Mix (16 μg RNase A, 40 U RNase T1, Thermo Scientific), and 1 μL of Benzonase (5 U, EMD Millipore)) for 120 min at 37 ℃. Following this, nucleic acids were immediately extracted using the TIANamp Viral Genome DNA/RNA extraction kit (TIANGEN, China), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, a DNA sequencing library was constructed utilizing the NEB Next Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines, with unique index codes assigned to each sample. The library’s quality was confirmed using an Agilent 2100 instrument. Index-coded samples were then clustered using the Illumina PE Cluster Kit (Illumina, USA) on a cBot Cluster Generation System, following the manufacturer’s protocols. Following cluster generation, the DNA libraries were subjected to metagenome shotgun sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq platform, resulting in the generation of 150 bp paired-end reads.

# Bulk metagenomic sequencing

For bulk metagenomic analyses, each fecal specimen from IBD patients or healthy controls was subjected to microbial DNA extraction using the TIANamp Stool DNA Kit (TIANGEN, China). DNA quality was assessed using the Qubit 2.0 system, and the extracted DNA samples were stored at − 80 ℃ until needed. After that, the DNA library and bulk metagenomic sequencing were consistent with the operations of the VLP samples.
