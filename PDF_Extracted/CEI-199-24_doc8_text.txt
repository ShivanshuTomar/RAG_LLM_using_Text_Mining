Microbiota-derived enzymatic activities generate metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and kynurenines. SCFA is involved in stimulating colonic regulatory T cells (Tregs) and differentiation of naive CD4 T cells through inhibition of histone/protein deacetylases (HDACs) via specific G-protein-coupled receptors signalling. This results in increased histone acetylation in the forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3) gene together with an increased FoxP3 expression. Kynurenines (tryptophan metabolites) activate the AhR pathway to polarize naive T cells into FoxP3+ Tregs. Bacteroides fragilis-derived polysaccharide A (PSA), induces differentiation of naive CD4 T cells towards interleukin (IL)-10-producing Tregs or into type 1 (Tr1) regulatory T cells Tregs (FoxP3−) via plasmacytoid dendritic cell stimulation. Additionally, an increase in gut-homing of IL-10-producing Treg cells and differentiation of Tregs is induced by retinoic acid generated by dendritic cells in the presence of microbial antigens.
