# Integrating omics for a better understanding of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: a step towards personalized medicine

# Abstract

Background: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a multifactorial chronic disease. Understanding only one aspect of IBD pathogenesis does not reflect the complex nature of IBD nor will it improve its clinical management. Therefore, it is vital to dissect the interactions between the different players in IBD pathogenesis in order to understand the biology of the disease and enhance its clinical outcomes.

Aims: To provide an overview of the available omics data used to assess the potential mechanisms through which various players are contributing to IBD pathogenesis and propose a precision medicine model to fill the current knowledge gap in IBD.

Results: Several studies have reported microbial dysbiosis, immune and metabolic dysregulation in IBD patients, however, this data is not sufficient to create signatures that can differentiate between the disease subtypes or between disease relapse and remission.

Conclusions: We summarized the current knowledge in the application of omics in IBD patients, and we showed that the current knowledge gap in IBD hinders the improvements of clinical decision for treatment as well as the prediction of disease relapse. We propose one way to fill this gap by implementing integrative analysis of various omics datasets generated from one patient at a single time point.

# Background

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, resulting from the complex interactions between genetic makeup, microbiome composition, environmental factors, and mucosal immune response [1]. IBD is characterized by the repeated alternating cycles of clinical relapse and remission [2] and in the absence of an adequate treatment, a chronic inflammation leading to irreversible intestinal damages [3]. Based on the disease manifestation, IBD is classified into three major subtypes [4]: Ulcerative Colitis (UC), which primarily affects the colon, Crohn’s disease (CD) which affects various GI sites [5], and a third subtype where histology assessments done on patients do not categorize to either UC or CD. This subtype is defined as “Inflammatory Bowel Disease, type unclassified” or “Undetermined” (IBD-U) [6, 7]. IBD is a lifelong disease that substantially reduces the quality of life for the patients and their families [8].

Although the first case of UC was reported in Europe in 1875 [9] and CD was first reported in USA in 1932 [10], IBD was still a rare disease until the second half of the 20th century. Post-World War II, a rapid increase in the incidence of UC and CD had been reported, with more than 5 million people affected worldwide [11–13]. This drastic increase in IBD patterns suggest that other factors aside from industrialization must be involved in driving.
