# Role of the IL‑6/IL‑6R axis in immune system

# Innate immunity and acute phase response

Amplified levels of acute-phase proteins (APPs), including serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, fibrinogen, and haptoglobin, are considered the hallmark of inflammation, and measurement of these proteins could be helpful in the monitoring of inflammatory states (Pincus and Sokka 2009). In this context, released IL-6 by hepatocytes leads to instigating the acute phase response and release of APPs (Gabay and Kushner 1999). To prove the role of IL-6 in the initiation of acute-phase responses, tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6R mAb, was used, and the results showed that by inhibiting the IL-6/IL-6R axis signals, the CRP level was normalized (Genovese et al. 2008).

In innate immunity, it has been revealed that several immune and stromal cells are able to release and respond to IL-6 (Calabrese and Rose-John 2014; Mauer et al. 2014). Therefore, IL-6 can be essential in inducing innate immune responses and stromal cell interactions (West 2019). As the rate of inflammation increases in an autocrine manner, IL-6 can lead to the switching of acute to chronic inflammatory responses (Caiello et al. 2014). Endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages are responsible for releasing IL-6 throughout acute inflammation, resulting in the expression of some adhesion molecules and chemokines by smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells involved in neutrophils recruitment (Fielding et al. 2008; Mauer et al. 2014).

Another important role of IL-6 in the innate immune system is to increase the survival of neutrophils by reducing their apoptosis, which leads to chronic inflammation (Asensi et al. 2004). Some stromal cells, despite expressing gp130, cannot respond to IL-6 due to the lack of IL-6R expression (Modur et al. 1997; Hurst et al. 2001). During chronic inflammation, the shedding of mIL-6R from neutrophils gives them the ability to respond to IL-6 and release chemokines involved in monocyte recruitment, such as CCL2, leading to monocyte infiltration in the site of inflammation (Hurst et al. 2001; Gabay 2006). Like numerous cells, human endothelial cells express gp130 in the absence of IL-6R, whereas sIL-6R-mediated trans-signaling upsurges the expression of adhesive molecules by endothelial cells, resulting in neutrophil rolling and adhesion to migrate into the inflamed tissue as well as vascular inflammation (Modur et al. 1997; Romano et al. 1997; Rose-John 2012).

# Adaptive immunity

Based on available knowledge, activated T and B lymphocytes are the main arms of cellular and humoral immunity, involved in inflammation induction and antibody production (Park et al. 2014). In adaptive immunity, IL-6 plays a pivotal role in activating T and B cells (Boe et al. 1999). IL-6 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) participate in the differentiation of Th17 cells, which are the main producer of IL-17 (Chonov et al. 2019). On the other hand, CD4 + CD25+ Foxp3 + regulatory T (Treg) cells are the controller of Th17 cells, especially in an autoimmune condition. Because TGF-β is essential for Tregs differentiation, the presence of IL-6 in the environment prevents TGF-dependent Tregs differentiation, which leads to an increase in Th17 destructive responses (Bettelli et al. 2006).

Interestingly, in addition to IL-17, Th17 can also produce IL-6, which helps induce differentiation and enhance Th17 responses in an autocrine manner (Ogura et al. 2008). Moreover, IL-6 and IL-17 produced by Th17 affect fibroblasts to release IL-6 and further inflammatory responses (Ota et al. 2015). Produced IL-6 by T cells induces the B cell's maturation into plasma cells (Muraguchi et al. 1988). Furthermore, IL-21 producer T cell subsets induced by IL-6 are involved in B cell maturation (Diehl et al. 2012; Yang and Rincon 2016). As a result, IL-6 is indirectly involved in antibody production. In this regard, it has been shown that antibody-mediated responses in animals with IL-6 deficiency are significantly reduced, associated with increased susceptibility to infection (Kopf et al. 1994).

On the other hand, IL-6 may also induce regulatory and anti-inflammatory responses because this cytokine can induce regulatory B cells (Bregs) (Rosser et al. 2014; Jansen et al. 2021). IL-6 can also link adaptive and innate immunity because IL-6-producing B cells stimulate stromal and innate immune cells to produce pro-inflammatory mediators, promoting inflammation (Hunter and Jones 2015).

Another imperative biological activity of IL-6 is participation in fibrosis processes, a common feature of chronic inflammatory diseases (Barnes et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2019). IL-6, during the initial phases of inflammation, induces epithelial and mesenchymal cells to stimulate polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) recruitment, which is important for wound healing (Hunter and Jones 2015).
